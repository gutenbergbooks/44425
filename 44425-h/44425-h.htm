    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> had been down to
      spend a summer&rsquo;s day at Eton. Dear old Eton! There is no place where
      a summer&rsquo;s day can be more happily spent, especially by those to
      whom the spot is hallowed by the memory of boyish days. The &ldquo;playing-fields&rdquo;
      are delightful, in spite of the passage through the same being a service
      of danger when cricket-balls whiz recklessly past your ear, and a
      courteous &ldquo;thank you!&rdquo; invites your hand to restore to its
      owner the engine which has nearly broken your head. &ldquo;Poet&rsquo;s
      Walk&rdquo; is charming, although its memories may not be entirely
      pleasant if you chance in your boyhood to have been &ldquo;fag&rdquo; to
      some &ldquo;sixth-form&rdquo; master whose tea you had to carry out to
      that pleasant resort. The &ldquo;school-yard&rdquo; also is not without
      its recommendations, though when one has attained the mature age of
      forty-five one feels rather as if one had no business there, standing
      among a crowd of fellows of a younger and happier age, the only idler
      among the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      On <span class="pagenum"><a name="link002" id="link002"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p002.jpg">002</a></span>the particular
      day of which I speak, I had rambled about with those boys I knew, gathered
      as much pleasure as I could from the memories which clung around the
      precincts of the old college, and afterwards strolled out along the banks
      of the river in the direction of Surly. The weather being rather hot,
      although evening was approaching, I thought it well to halt in the
      immediate neighbourhood of Surly Hall, and having seated myself in the
      shadiest place I could find, began to think over the various &ldquo;Fourths
      of June&rdquo; and &ldquo;Election Saturdays&rdquo; which I had witnessed
      in that famous locality, until I not unnaturally fell fast asleep. I do
      not know how long I remained in this comfortable state, but I was suddenly
      aroused by the sound of voices, and immediately opened my eyes and looked
      around to discover the quarter from which they proceeded. It was not long
      before I was enlightened upon this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly opposite the spot upon which I had seated myself was a little
      island in the very middle of the river, dividing the water which flowed on
      each side of it and left it high and dry. This island was of no great
      size, and, I should imagine, of no great value either, being covered with
      reeds and willows, and apparently fit for nothing except to afford shelter
      to moor-hens and water-rats, which creatures probably found it an
      exceedingly convenient habitation. Upon the present occasion, however,
      beings of a different nature altogether appeared to have taken possession
      of the island. At a plain deal table were seated two ancient individuals
      of kingly and majestic mien. He who sat at the end of the table wore a
      white beard of mighty size, which streamed downward to his waist; whilst
      his companion, who <span class="pagenum"><a name="link003" id="link003"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p003.jpg">003</a></span>sat at his right
      hand, and was of a dark and swarthy complexion, boasted but little beard,
      but made up for the deficiency by the size and length of the black
      appendages which adorned his upper lip. Each of these two kings (for such
      the crowns upon their heads betokened them to be, and the regal dignity of
      their general appearance gave further proof of their condition) grasped in
      his hand a tumbler which was apparently full of liquor more potent than
      the water which flowed around them, whilst a huge pewter pot (which
      constituted the only other furniture of their table) bore witness to the
      quarter from whence their potations had been supplied.

    </h4>
    <p>
      As I regarded these two strange beings with an astonishment not altogether
      unmixed with reverential awe (for I saw at once that they were more than
      ordinary mortals), he at the end of the table broke silence, and striking
      his fist upon the board in an emphatic manner, thus addressed his
      companion: &ldquo;Brother Rhine!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link004" id="link004"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p004.jpg">004</a></span>said he, &ldquo;welcome
      to old England. Thames gives thee hearty welcome.&rdquo; The other gravely
      bowed his head in acknowledgment of this cordial speech, but uttered no
      word in reply, and methought I perceived upon his royal countenance some
      signs such as appear upon the face of a passenger between Dover and Calais
      whom the ocean has rudely shaken. Father Thames (for as such I
      instinctively recognised the first speaker) appeared to make a somewhat
      similar observation, for he forthwith addressed his friend a second time
      in these words: &ldquo;What aileth thee, Brother Rhine? Lovest thou not
      this change of climate, or dost thou fear that thy waters will overflow or
      thy tributary streams rebel during thy brief absence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He who was thus accosted smiled grimly, and stroked his dark moustache as
      he made answer: &ldquo;Neither the one nor the other, Brother Thames. It
      is but thine English ale which is somewhat more potent than my native
      drink. But, craving thy pardon, the matter will soon be set right. A
      trusty messenger should by this time be arriving with a supply of mine own
      Rhine wine, and I would fain have thee try the vintage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The countenance of Father Thames visibly darkened. &ldquo;I forsake not
      mine ale,&rdquo; said he gloomily. &ldquo;It gladdens the heart and
      strengthens the frame more than the juice of grape.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;there are merry hearts,
      strong frames, and brave spirits in plenty upon my banks; and thus it has
      ever been, as many an old legend can well bear witness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; responded Father Thames, though still somewhat
      moodily. &ldquo;But yet for legends and stories of <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link005" id="link005"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p005.jpg">005</a></span>the olden time
      my river lacketh not a good supply, nor are British hearts less merry or
      British spirits less brave than those of whom thou makest thy boast.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it not, I doubt it not,&rdquo; rejoined the monarch of the
      Rhine. &ldquo;But see, here comes my messenger!&rdquo; As he spoke, I
      looked up and beheld an enormous eagle, carrying a huge silver flagon in
      his beak and another in each of his claws, and hovering immediately over
      the heads of the two kings. Presently he alighted, deposited his precious
      burdens upon the table directly in front of the Rhine king, and obediently
      waited for orders <span class="pagenum"><a name="link006" id="link006"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p006.jpg">006</a></span>behind his
      master. The latter lost no time in hesitation over his course of
      procedure. Taking up the vessel from which he had recently drank, he
      dipped it several times in the running water at his feet until all traces
      of the ale had disappeared, then, filling it full with sparkling wine from
      one of the flagons before him, he looked steadily at his companion,
      gravely inclined his head towards him, and then tossed off his liquor with
      an air of supreme satisfaction, and replaced his tumbler upon the table.

    <p>
      Father Thames meanwhile had not been idle. Whilst his brother king was
      thus engaged, he had drawn the pewter pot nearer to himself and
      replenished his tumbler with foaming ale. &ldquo;Your health, Brother
      Rhine,&rdquo; he shouted in a stentorian voice, and winking one eye in a
      peculiar but not unpleasant manner, he drained his glass to the dregs. A
      change at once appeared to come over his countenance&mdash;it positively
      sparkled with fun; a species of light appeared to play around his head as
      if the rays of the sun had come to give a parting radiance to his crown
      before they retired for the night. His whole face beamed with internal and
      intense satisfaction, and once more striking his hand on the table, he
      spoke thus: &ldquo;Brother Rhine, we have each his own liquor and each his
      own river. Let <span class="pagenum"><a name="link007" id="link007"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p007.jpg">007</a></span>each enjoy his
      own! Live and let live. But whilst we sit here so happily, let us while
      away the time by recounting some of the legends for which our banks are so
      famous, and of which we each have a good store.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; cried he of the Rhine; &ldquo;and as thou hast
      proposed the pastime, Brother Thames, do thou begin.&rdquo; Thus adjured,
      Father Thames, having previously filled and emptied his tumbler once more,
      cleared his throat and commenced the history of&mdash;

    <h2>
      THE GREAT BOAR OF WINDSOR FOREST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> need scarcely
      tell you that England was not always what it is to-day, and that the
      advance of time has wrought very considerable changes in the scenery of
      the country through which the waters of the Thames hold their course. The
      river which bears my name now washes fertile shores which were once barren
      plains, and pleasant towns and smiling meadows have replaced wild thickets
      and dense forests. I suppose there never was a more delightful forest than
      that of which Windsor can boast. When mortals speak of Windsor Forest,
      they generally associate therewith the name of Herne the Hunter, who was
      quite a character in his way, had an oak of his own, and has had more than
      one very readable story written about him. But Herne the Hunter is quite a
      modern hero compared with those of whom I am about to tell you. I speak of
      old, very old days, and if I do not give you the exact date when the
      events occurred which I shall presently relate, it is only because I haven&rsquo;t
      the least idea what that <span class="pagenum"><a name="link008"
      id="link008"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p008.jpg">008</a></span>date
      may have been. But, be it what you will, it is an undoubted fact that
      long, long ago there was a forest which stretched down to the very edge of
      my river near to this particular spot, and this forest was the abode of
      many strange and incomprehensible beings.

      Perhaps the most curious and most disagreeable of these in the days I
      speak of was a personage familiarly termed the Wild <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link009" id="link009"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p009.jpg">009</a></span>Boar of Windsor.
      This creature was of enormous size and strength, and was generally
      acknowledged as the king of his tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wild boars were at that time numerous in England, and I believe, if the
      truth were known, that fairies and Fairyland power had much to do with
      their existence. That power has passed away now, or at least has so
      greatly diminished that, although there are plenty of persons left who may
      be correctly described by a word which sounds exactly like the name of the
      animal in question, yet the fairies have nothing to do with this. Magic
      power no longer converts the objects of its wrath into brute beasts or
      hideous monsters, as was frequently the case in the good old times of
      which I speak. Whether the Wild Boar in question was the victim of some
      such vengeance, or whether he had always been what he appeared in those
      days, it is not necessary to inquire. Anyhow, he was certainly more than
      mortal. He had apparently the gift of prophecy, for his grunts were often
      repeated by his subservient followers as having foretold subsequent events
      with singular accuracy, and he was not unfrequently sought out by persons
      who desired to be acquainted beforehand with future events, which has in
      all ages been a foolish weakness to which human nature has been subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Boar had a numerous family, who were daily fed out of silver dishes,
      sitting all in a row and eating with as much decorum as could be expected.
      It is not, however, of his family or domestic life that I am about to tell
      you to-day, but of the extraordinary events which occurred in connection
      with the efforts made by mankind to rid themselves of this exceedingly
      troublesome creature. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link010" id="link010"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p010.jpg">010</a></span>For although, as
      I have already said, the ignorant peasants of the neighbourhood held the
      Boar in great reverence, and used to creep timidly into the forest in
      search of the knowledge which he was said to possess, and which <i>they</i>
      certainly lacked, there were others who regarded the kingly Boar as an
      unmitigated nuisance. This was scarcely wonderful, since he and his tribe
      had the most unpleasant habit of issuing forth from the forest, and
      devastating the country far and wide, making everybody as uncomfortable as
      possible.

      Ever since I have known this country, which is now a good many years ago,
      the people who inhabit it have liked to be as comfortable as they could
      be, especially when living quietly in their own homes, intrusion into
      which they have always greatly resented. &ldquo;An Englishman&rsquo;s
      house is his castle&rdquo; is a very old proverb amongst them, and they
      have a strong attachment to the particular localities in which they have
      been bom and bred. So that when this Boar ravaged right and left, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link011" id="link011"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p011.jpg">011</a></span>respected no man&rsquo;s
      castle, uprooted everybody&rsquo;s crops, and made himself generally
      disagreeable, it was quite natural that the worthy people who suffered
      from his depredations should feel exceedingly annoyed. After a while, this
      annoyance took the form of an earnest desire to get rid of the monster.
      The question, however, of the means to be employed to accomplish this
      desirable result was by no means easy of solution. To dig pits, such as
      were in those days commonly used for the destruction of wild animals,
      would have been an utterly useless proceeding when employed against a
      creature of such supernatural sagacity. Guns had not been invented; no dog
      could be found strong and fierce enough to attack the monster; and the
      more the poor people thought of the matter the more hopeless did their
      case appear. Law and order were not then what they are now, and there
      existed no county constabulary to whom, in the present day, the business
      would at once be referred with a perfect certainty that the wrong-doer
      would be forthwith arrested and punished. Nor had the pious founder of
      Eton College as yet existed, or doubtless aid would have been sought by
      the sufferers from the provost and fellows of that famous abode of
      learning. Their prayers at least would have been invoked, for these
      saintly men have always been persons of great age, profound wisdom, and
      extreme piety, and the only doubt might have been lest, as the Boar had
      been so long in existence, they might not have considered him as one of
      the institutions of their country, and declined to take any steps against
      him in consequence. But, as they themselves did not then exist, the
      question did not arise, and the Boar continued supreme.

    <p>
      For <span class="pagenum"><a name="link012" id="link012"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p012.jpg">012</a></span>aught I know, he
      might have continued so down to this day but for the circumstances which I
      am about to relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A poor woman of the neighbourhood dreamed that she was about to become the
      mother of the largest family that the world had ever seen. This being a
      thing which her husband, being in straitened circumstances, deemed by no
      means desirable, he received the news with disgust only tempered by
      disbelief, and treated his helpmate to language of a rough and
      discourteous character. His frame of mind changed, however, when, as years
      rolled on, one child only claimed him for its father, which of course
      entitled him to sneer at his wife and her dreams as a good husband would
      naturally do under such circumstances. The child, however, was one of no
      ordinary description. Not only was he the largest and most strongly made
      child ever seen in these parts, but he showed from an early age a singular
      and precocious intelligence. Before the time when infants are supposed to
      be able to convey their meaning to their friends by intelligible
      utterances, a very remarkable instance of this precocity occurred. The
      father and mother (whose names have not been handed down to posterity)
      were discussing the future of their promising babe in his presence, and
      one asked of the other the question what distinguishing name should be
      given to so fine a child. The astonishment of the parents may be imagined
      when the infant, suddenly sitting upright in his mother&rsquo;s lap, and
      steadfastly regarding his father, winked his left eye violently, laid the
      first finger of his right hand against his little nose in a confidential
      manner, and emphatically pronounced the word &ldquo;Smith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether <span class="pagenum"><a name="link013" id="link013"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p013.jpg">013</a></span>this proceeding
      was, by the powers of magic, ordered and decreed with a view to the
      fulfilment of the dream of the child&rsquo;s mother, is a question upon
      which (like most others) various opinions may be entertained. Certain,
      however, it is that the result justifies the idea, inasmuch as the
      astonished parents obeyed the commands of their offspring, and gave him
      that name which has since been borne by so many of the inhabitants of this
      island, and of which, (despite all other accounts bearing the stamp of
      probability) this child was the inventor and founder.

      As the babe grew older, his wondrous strength was the subject of general
      remark. His favourite plaything was a club, much thicker at one end than
      the other, and nearly as tall as himself. This he would brandish about
      over his head to the imminent danger of the bystanders, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link014" id="link014"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p014.jpg">014</a></span>or would
      lovingly encircle with his arm, leaning his head against it, as he sat
      upon the ground pondering over some plans only known to himself with a
      more than childish gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      These, you must know, were the days of the worthy Druids, who guided the
      religious feelings of the country, and, as has been occasionally the
      fashion of ecclesiastics in all ages, used the ignorance and superstition
      of the people to establish their own authority.&lsquo;Take them all in
      all, I don&rsquo;t know that they were worse than other priests whom I
      have seen upon my banks in later ages; but they had an awkward habit of
      occasionally discovering that their personal enemies were required by the
      gods as a sacrifice, and thus not unfrequently managed to propitiate their
      own vengeance and that of the irate deities at one and the same moment.
      Smith&rsquo;s father, having been unlucky enough to fall under the ban of
      one of these respectable gentlemen, was sacrificed one fine morning, in
      spite of all his protestations; and, his mother having died previously,
      the child was left an orphan, poor and desolate. Under these circumstances
      you will wonder what became of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no poor-laws, and consequently no workhouses, in those days.
      &ldquo;Relieving officers&rdquo; were unknown, and even parish beadles had
      not come into being. Indeed, if this had been the case, I should have no
      legend to relate to you upon my present theme. Smith would have lived a
      different life altogether. He would very likely have been the interesting
      subject of discussion between several parishes, each laudably anxious to
      escape being called upon to pay for his nurture and education, who would
      possibly have spent in <span class="pagenum"><a name="link015" id="link015"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p015.jpg">015</a></span>the contest more

      Eventually he would have been consigned to the workhouse school until he
      had arrived at an age when he might possibly have been able to learn
      something, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link016" id="link016"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p016.jpg">016</a></span>at which moment
      this would very properly have been prevented by his being transferred to
      the enlivening employment of rook-keeping, from which he would have
      gradually risen to the position of a day-labourer upon some neighbouring
      farm, unless he had evinced sufficient intellectual ability to have
      aspired to the rank and dignity of &ldquo;waggoner&rsquo;s mate.&rdquo;
      This brilliant career, however, was not open to our hero in the benighted
      days of which I speak. This being so, he not unnaturally did something
      else. He disappeared from the eyes of the world in a manner which would
      have been perfectly marvellous if there had been anybody who cared to
      marvel at it. This, however, was not the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The venerable Druid who had sacrificed the child&rsquo;s father took no
      trouble about the child, though he would probably have sacrificed him too
      with the greatest pleasure had any hint been given him upon the subject.
      The people who had permitted and sanctioned the deed never gave a thought
      to the infant who had thereby been left destitute. Public opinion was not
      in existence, and as this island had not then, as it has now, what is
      popularly called &ldquo;the blessing of a Free Press,&rdquo; the attention
      of the neighbourhood was not called to such trifling occurrences. So Smith&rsquo;s
      father perished and Smith disappeared, without notice or remark from
      anybody. What really happened to the lad is known, of course, to me, and
      is sufficiently laughable. He wandered into the forest, and became the
      friend and companion of the toads, for which Windsor has always been
      famous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although mortals are not generally aware of the fact, it is well
      known, brother, to you and me, that toads <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link017" id="link017"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p017.jpg">017</a></span>are among the
      wisest and most intelligent of animals. They may be called ugly by those
      who only judge of character and worth by the standard of that beauty which
      is after all but skin-deep; they may be termed slimy and unpleasant by
      those who cannot see below the surface; they may even be deemed stupid by
      people who are unable to discern the intellectual vigour which shines
      forth in the extraordinary brightness of the eye of a well-bred toad. But,
      as we know full well, a toad is one of the most powerful of created beings
      in his knowledge of magic and of hidden art. How many are the buried
      treasures over which a toad sits as guardian, laughing to himself at the
      busy mortals above who would give their eyes and ears to possess that
      which is really within their reach if they did but know it! And, apart
      from this peculiar point of view, how happy the life of a well-regulated
      toad!&mdash;how simple his tastes; how free from care his heart, how
      tranquil his existence, so long as he is permitted to enjoy it without
      being stamped upon by the cruel heel of mortal, or swallowed by the
      voracious mouth of snake. With the toads of the forest, then, Smith made
      his home; and often did I see him in those old days, sporting with his
      strange playmates among the roots of the gigantic trees which grew down to
      my very water&rsquo;s edge, sometimes playing leap-frog, at other moments
      hopping races, and not unfrequently reclining by the side of one of the
      worthy toads, his arm thrown around it, and its body serving as a
      resting-place for his infant head and shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these strange instructors did little Smith receive an education which
      fitted him for the career which <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link018" id="link018"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p018.jpg">018</a></span>he had chalked
      out for himself. From them he learned more than ordinary mortals could
      have taught him; and meanwhile the wholesome and quiet life which he led
      in the forest caused him to increase daily in bodily strength, so that he
      bid fair to rival Hercules before he arrived at manhood.

      All this time the Boar continued to pursue his ravages unchecked and
      unmolested, and had become more than ever the terror of the surrounding
      country. In vain did the Druids denounce him: the more they cursed the
      more he seemed to prosper, and the whole framework of society was shaken
      by this terrible animal, The effect, moreover, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link019" id="link019"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p019.jpg">019</a></span>throughout the
      whole island, was the reverse of agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have noticed, in the struggles of mankind for supremacy, that when one
      particular nation has obtained, whether by good fortune or good
      organization, great military successes, it sometimes happens that the
      citizens of that nation become puffed up and insolent beyond measure,
      considering that the mere fact of belonging to that victorious country
      stamps a man (however intellectually poor or morally imbecile) as
      something superior to his fellow-creatures, and gives him a right to be as
      rude and disagreeable as he pleases. Such was at this time the precise
      result of the Boar&rsquo;s undiminished power. Every pig in the island
      thought himself far superior to any other animal. The insolence of Pigdom
      became rapidly intolerable; these unpleasant animals thrust their snouts
      into everybody else&rsquo;s dish, and England was threatened with a
      porcine yoke which would inevitably have interfered with that great future
      which she was destined to achieve in afteryears. However, England has
      never been without her Smith in the hour of danger, and this, the first
      individual of that illustrious name, set the example which his
      descendants, have so often followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having formed the noble determination to free his country or perish in the
      attempt, he next determined to avoid the latter alternative if he possibly
      could. The manner in which he should proceed required, indeed, his most
      careful consideration. Instructed as he had been in magic arts by the
      excellent toads, he knew full well that he had to cope with an adversary
      who was said to be able to fight with the same weapons. Caution, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link020" id="link020"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p020.jpg">020</a></span>therefore, as
      well as skill, was certainly necessary, and his first object was to
      discover the extent of the enemy&rsquo;s power, and whether there existed
      any means by which it could be lessened. To do this, however, it was
      necessary to employ some spy to obtain intelligence upon which reliance
      might be placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No mortal had ever dared to penetrate the lair of the great Boar; and
      those who wished to hear him grunt had never ventured to do more than
      creep, with stealthy step and timorous aspect, on the outer verge of the
      great thicket which he had been seen to enter after his marauding
      excursions. Nor, indeed, was it easy to find any four-footed animal who
      would undertake the task. The wolves and foxes, of which there were a very
      great number in Windsor Forest, respectfully but firmly declined; the
      hares and rabbits squeaked and ran away at the very idea; and the stoats
      and weasels declared that it was no business of theirs, and they could not
      interfere in such matters. Then there were the birds; but these simple
      creatures have always had a horror of magic and witchcraft, and there was
      nothing to be done with <i>them.</i> The tender wood-pigeons coo&rsquo;d
      out their reluctance to dabble with anything which was not pure and holy
      and loving; the robin pretended not to hear, and sang his morning hymn
      with a provoking vehemence whilst Smith was accosting him; the owl shook
      her head gravely and gave vent to a low hoot of determined refusal; while
      the gaudy jays flew away laughing and shrieking in a most impertinent
      manner, which left no hope of their compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus baffled in his first attempt, Smith once more consulted the toads,
      and asked the oldest and wisest of them <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link021" id="link021"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p021.jpg">021</a></span>for his advice,
      which was promptly given. &ldquo;The Foul Swine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is
      not the great magician which he pretends. His tusks are long and his years
      many, but there are those within and without the forest more powerful than
      he. Your task is certainly one of some difficulty. Nevertheless, there is
      an ancient proverb well known among us toads which will be of great use to
      you, and which we are bound never to repeat to mortal ear save under
      certain conditions. The first of these is, that the mortal to whom we may
      repeat it must have passed at least half his life with our own people, and
      have learned to speak the toad language like a native. As you have now
      passed considerably more than the prescribed period among us, and (except
      perhaps as regards spitting) are in all respects a regular toad, this
      first condition has evidently been fulfilled in your case. The second
      condition requires that the person to whom the proverb shall be imparted
      must have rendered service to the toad people by killing at least twenty
      of our natural enemies, the snakes. This service you have yet to perform.
      The third condition simply stipulates that the individual in question
      shall bind himself by the most solemn oath known to toads&mdash;namely, by
      the eyes of the two golden toads which sit day and night at the foot of
      the throne of the Emperor of China&mdash;that he will set himself
      strenuously to perform the task to which the proverb alludes. About this
      you will probably find no difficulty, and therefore it is really only with
      the second condition that you need trouble yourself at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith listened with great attention to the remarks made by his ancient
      friend, and lost no time in qualifying <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link022" id="link022"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p022.jpg">022</a></span>himself to be
      the recipient of the desired information by destroying the requisite
      number of snakes. That very evening his art as a snake-charmer was so
      successfully practised, that more than fifty of the creatures lay twisting
      and writhing in front of the toads&rsquo; favourite trees, and were
      presently dispatched by vigorous blows from the stalwart arm of Smith.

      This feat having been performed, he requested the venerable toad to impart
      the proverb upon which so much might depend. The worthy old gentleman was
      nothing loath, and, having given an exulting croak over the bodies of his
      slain foemen, spat twice in the air for joy, and proceeded to administer
      the toad-oath, which pledged Smith to strive his utmost to perform some
      task as yet unknown. Great, however, was his delight at finding that this
      task was <span class="pagenum"><a name="link023" id="link023"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p023.jpg">023</a></span>none other than
      the very one to which he had already determined to devote his life,
      namely, the destruction of the Great Boar. And thus ran the proverb:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Blood of slayer and of slain
Must together blended be
Ere the Boar&rsquo;s detested reign
Cease, and Windsor shall be free.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      These words having been pronounced by the toad with due solemnity, he
      again went through the apparently unnecessary, not to say unpleasant,
      process of spitting twice, after which he quietly subsided, and crept
      under a large root, with a view to a long nap, which might last for a day,
      a year, or a century, as the humour took him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith now set himself seriously to consider what should be done, and what
      was the exact meaning of the proverb. It was his earnest wish that the
      &ldquo;detested reign&rdquo; of the Boar should cease as soon as possible,
      but what the blending together of the blood of the slayer and the slain
      could possibly mean was an exceedingly hard puzzle, and one which he knew
      not how to unravel. As, however, he was bound to do his best to perform
      the task to the accomplishment of which he had pledged himself, he
      determined to sally forth from the forest and endeavour to seek the aid
      which the birds and beasts within it were unable to afford him.
      Accordingly, he marched back into society, which, if not precisely
      civilised, was somewhat different from that of the toads and other
      creatures who had for the best part of his life been his only companions.
      Had he lived some years later, there can be little doubt that his
      reappearance would <span class="pagenum"><a name="link024" id="link024"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p024.jpg">024</a></span>have created
      considerable surprise, and his costume would have been in singular
      contrast with that of ordinary men. As, however, at that period of the
      island&rsquo;s history, men wore very little costume at all beyond that
      which nature had bestowed upon them, this was no difficulty in the way of
      our hero&rsquo;s return. Moreover, the education given him by the toads
      had been so vastly superior to that which he would have received at the
      hands of his fellow-men, that there was nothing strange, uncouth, or
      remarkable either in his speech or manners, which, in fact, contrasted
      favourably with those of the human beings whom he was likely to meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days the villages were small and the dwellings comparatively few
      and far between. The country upon the borders of the forest presented a
      barren and miserable appearance, mainly in consequence of the extreme
      poverty of its inhabitants, who were deterred from the agricultural
      pursuits which they would otherwise have followed by the constant ravages
      of the cruel Boar. It was, therefore, a rare thing to see many people in
      that part of the country, and Smith, had he known it, would have been
      surprised at the number he saw as he strode forward on his way. As,
      however, he had been so long in the forest as to have forgotten the usual
      habits of the peasantry outside, he was not astonished at all, and saw
      without wonder that people were hurrying along in the same direction as
      himself from every quarter. It struck him as rather strange that they
      should all be going the same way, and, being desirous ol knowing the
      reason why, he took the not unnatural course of asking a peasant woman
      whom he overtook. &ldquo;Do you not know?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Are
      you a stranger in <span class="pagenum"><a name="link025" id="link025"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p025.jpg">025</a></span>the country, not
      to have heard that the great Druidess Bertha sacrifices to-day on Ascot
      Heath?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it not,&rdquo; returned Smith, and followed up his answer by
      an inquiry as to who the great Druidess Bertha might be. The peasant woman
      appeared to be quite shocked at his ignorance, but, with the gossiping
      propensity which occasionally besets the weaker portion of her sex, began
      instantly to impart to him all she knew and a good deal more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertha, it seemed, was a person whose origin was shrouded in mystery. She
      had been educated by the Druids, and brought up as a female priestess of
      that reverend society. Although still young, she was supposed to have
      attained to great sanctity, and was immensely venerated by the peasantry.
      One thing alone distinguished her from the other Druids, namely, her
      unconquerable objection to human sacrifice; and Smith found, on further
      inquiry, that to-day&rsquo;s ceremony was to consist only of the slaughter
      of oxen and sheep, and the offering of corn and fruits to the deities,
      whose aid was to be once more invoked against the tyranny of the Great
      Boar of Windsor. The account which he had heard made our hero more than
      ever desirous to witness the ceremony and to see the Druidess, and he
      accordingly followed the crowd to the sacred heath upon which it was to
      take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascot Heath was at that time somewhat different from its present
      condition. You remember, Brother Rhine, when you were last in England,
      what a sight we saw together in that celebrated locality. All London
      seemed to have emptied itself upon Windsor and its neighbourhood. The
      heath was thronged with excited crowds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hundreds <span class="pagenum"><a name="link026" id="link026"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p026.jpg">026</a></span>upon hundreds of
      carts, gigs, and carriages of every description crowded one upon the
      other, and you owned that Rhineland had nothing to equal our Ascot week.
      Very different was the condition of things at the time of which I speak. I
      need hardly tell you that there was no &ldquo;grand stand&rdquo; in those
      days; the &ldquo;ring&rdquo; was as yet unknown; &ldquo;Aunt Sally&rdquo;
      was not, and never a gipsy had as yet appeared in the country. But the
      heath was wide and wild, rough and rugged, a fit place for the enactment
      of any such strange rites as those which his companion had led Smith to
      anticipate. He pushed boldly forward until he reached a spot from whence
      he could view the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very edge of the forest, beneath a gigantic oak, upon a piece of
      rising ground, stood a figure upon which he, in common with every one else
      around him, riveted his eyes with the most intense interest and attention.
      It was a woman of more than ordinary height, clothed from head to foot in
      white drapery, her hair failing loosely upon her shoulders, with a simple
      chaplet of oak-leaves over her forehead. Her features were such as
      impelled you to look a second time after you had once gazed upon her.
      Nobility was stamped upon her brow. Courage, truth, and every other virtue
      which ennobles those of mortal mould were imprinted upon the lineaments of
      that countenance. Erect she stood, gazing down upon the peasant crowd
      below; and while her right hand held the sickle with which she had been
      performing some of the mystic rites of her order, her left arm was far
      outstretched as she pointed in the direction of that part of the forest in
      which the mighty Boar had made <span class="pagenum"><a name="link027"
      id="link027"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p027.jpg">027</a></span>his
      home.

    <p>
      It was evident to Smith that the sacrifice, whatever it that <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link028" id="link028"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p028.jpg">028</a></span>not one word
      should escape him; and as all the people seemed animated by the same
      desire, a solemn and almost awful silence prevailed throughout the whole
      crowd. Then the Druidess spoke; her words fell clear and shrill upon the
      ears of her audience like the clarion notes of the trumpet which calls
      forth hosts to battle, and they pierced at once to the heart of Smith as
      they rang through the startled air. And thus spoke the Druidess:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Men of Britain&rsquo;s Holy Isle,
Spiritless and idle still
Rest ye here, and all the while
Forest demons work their will?

Barren lie your hungry fields,
Yielding nought for human food,
While your spirit tamely yields
To the Tyrant of the Wood.

Hear the Future! To the gods
While libations Druids pour,
Britain&rsquo;s Oak to ruin nods,
Rotten to the very core!

Craven spirits fear and hide
From the devastating foe.
Can the gods be satisfied
With a race of cowards? No!

What the mighty gods inspire
Bertha to her race imparts.
Hear ye all! the gods require
Stalwart arms and valiant hearts.

All the blood of victims slain
Never can your country save,
Till that country you sustain
With the daring of the brave.

Yet are ye no craven race;
If yourselves ye learn&rsquo;d to know,
Never would ye turn your face
From the coming of the foe.

Ah! the spirit moves me now,
Ancient spirit of the oak;
'Neath its mighty spell I bow,
Hear the words the gods evoke!

'Mid the throng I see below
Stands a man of courage true,
And I see a light I know
Flashing from his eye of blue.

'Tis the light of valiant strength,
And its flash reveals to me
That the hour is near at length
When my people shall be free;

Free from terror and from yoke
Of the sanguinary Boar.
Let the hero strike the stroke;
Ye are free for evermore!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link029" id="link029"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p029.jpg">029</a></span>Priestess
      pronounced her last words with such intense animation, as if inspired by
      some supernatural power, that they produced a wondrous effect upon those
      to whom they were addressed. Indeed, it was not only her manner of
      speaking, but the matter of the words to which she gave utterance, which
      was well calculated to excite the people. Bowed down and dispirited for
      years under a great misfortune, they suddenly heard that deliverance was
      at hand, and that he by whom it might be wrought was actually standing
      among them at that moment. The greatest excitement, therefore, naturally
      prevailed, and a low murmur of mingled joy, surprise, and awe ran through
      the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Druidess, meanwhile, stood still as a stone statue upon the hillock
      under the oak, gazing forward with eyes, fixed upon vacancy as if she were
      reading far into the Book of the Future, under the influence of some
      mighty spell. Her appearance, as of one in a trance, increased the
      reverential awe of the superstitious people, who remained for a few
      moments in a state of increasing doubt and wonder. Then some of them
      gathered courage and found voice to express the dearest wish of their
      hearts. &ldquo;Holy Bertha!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Sacred Maiden! <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link030" id="link030"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p030.jpg">030</a></span>Tell us who is
      our deliverer. Who is he that shall strike the stroke for our freedom?
      Where is he? How shall we find him?&rdquo; And, as he spoke, the people
      pressed forward eagerly as near to the sacred hillock as their dread of
      the maiden&rsquo;s sanctity would permit them to approach. With an
      imperious gesture she waved them back, and then, passing her hand across
      her brow, as if to brush away the trance which still partially obscured
      her vision for things present, she uttered the following words in a low
      and hurried tone:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;The strength of a god and the skill of a toad
Unite in the man who shall Windsor deliver;
His name shall be hallow&rsquo;d in every abode,
And henceforth shall be known in old England for ever!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      These words, although they possibly went but a very little way towards
      giving to the inquiring crowd the information they so anxiously desired,
      were of course very intelligible to Smith, even without the aid of any of
      that magic knowledge which he had acquired from his forest teachers. He
      was now certain, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the Druidess referred
      to him as the deliverer from the Great Boar, and that, having committed
      herself to such a prophecy, she and the priests of her order would, for
      their own sakes if for no better reason, do their very best to secure its
      fulfilment. But I am bound to say that other thoughts also occupied the
      breast of our hero. From the very first moment that he had set eyes upon
      the Druidess he had been struck with wondrous admiration. There was
      something in her appearance so majestic, so noble, and at the same time so
      winning, that the heart of Smith throbbed with new emotions, nor did he
      cease to gaze earnestly <span class="pagenum"><a name="link031"
      id="link031"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p031.jpg">031</a></span>at
      the sacred maiden during the whole time of her discourse. In fact, I
      believe that, almost unconsciously to himself, a fervent desire that
      Bertha the Druidess should become Mrs. Smith took possession of our hero&rsquo;s
      soul, and he fell a hopeless victim to &ldquo;Love at first sight&rdquo;
      without being aware of the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any friendly feeling, moreover, which might have been suggested by the
      outward appearance of the holy maid was tenfold increased when her words
      gave evidence that she was ready to help his accomplishment of that great
      object to which he had devoted his life. To be singled out from the crowd
      for praise, compliment, and prophecy of future distinction is an honour of
      which any man may be proud under general circumstances; but when the
      person who singles you out happens to be young and lovely, the flattery is
      not unfrequently of double sweetness, and tends to evoke a feeling which,
      if it takes its origin in gratitude, is not unlikely to become something
      warmer. Be this as it may, Smith felt towards the young Druidess as he had
      never felt before, and was by no means sorry that the circumstances in
      which he found himself rendered it absolutely necessary that he should
      seek a private interview with her as soon as possible. For, as no one but
      he himself could know that her words referred unmistakably to him, it was
      unlikely that he would be recognised as a leader or clothed with any
      authority unless some further steps were taken in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having pronounced the last words, Bertha had hastily retreated
      behind the oak, and there was little chance that she would show herself
      again upon that occasion.. But Smith had underrated both the foresight of
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link032" id="link032"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p032.jpg">032</a></span>the Druidess and
      the intelligence of her hearers. Many of these had observed the presence
      amongst them of an entire stranger, and as, from a very early period of
      their history, Britons have been tolerably good hands at &ldquo;putting
      two and two together,&rdquo; they had arrived at the conclusion that this
      individual was extremely likely to be the deliverer whom the Priestess had
      declared she saw amid the throng below.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days, bashful modesty was not, as now, the characteristic of a
      British crowd. Instinctively they pressed around the stranger, and
      addressed to him several observations which savoured more of curiosity
      than politeness. They were good-natured, to be sure, as British crowds are
      even to the present day; but not recognising in him at once the qualities
      which had been so easily perceptible to the inspired Bertha, they
      questioned him familiarly and as one of themselves. It was not long,
      however, before their manner changed. Smith told them plainly that he came
      from the forest, that toads and toad-mysteries were known to him, and that
      so far at least he answered to the description which they had lately heard
      as that of their deliverer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they listened to his words, the respect of the simple rustics for the
      speaker greatly increased; his answers were whispered from one to the
      other, and there appeared a general disposition to welcome him as their
      leader, if leader indeed there was to be. Seeing that the opportunity was
      favourable, but yet too cautious to push matters far upon the first onset,
      Smith begged the crowd to disperse, but promised that, if they were of the
      same mind three days hence, he would meet them upon the heath at that
      time. To this they agreed; and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link033" id="link033"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p033.jpg">033</a></span>having with some
      difficulty escaped from sundry loiterers who followed him, gaping and
      staring as if he had been some newly discovered monster, our hero returned
      to the forest and reported his adventures to his friends the toads. The
      latter listened with much satisfaction to his account of all that had
      happened, and gave him valuable advice as to his future proceedings. In
      accordance with their instructions, he again journeyed to the oak of Ascot
      Heath upon the next evening, and sought an interview with the Priestess
      upon whom his hopes were centred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interviews with Druidesses were not, in those days, very easy of
      accomplishment, and were not unattended with danger. For, if the Druids
      did not happen to approve, and <i>did</i> happen to discover the fact, the
      culprit stood an excellent chance of being speedily sacrificed. Smith,
      however, had no fear, and, as is proverbially the case, fortune favoured
      the brave. He met the holy maiden walking in the forest before he reached
      the oak. I really cannot tell you exactly what passed at the interview,
      but I know it resulted (as such interviews not unfrequently do) in the
      appointment of another. This also took place without any obstacle arising,
      and the result was that, when the time appointed for the reassembling of
      the people had arrived, Smith&rsquo;s plans were pretty well matured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing near the sacred oak, he addressed the crowd before him in brief
      but energetic words. He pointed out to them the misery which their country
      had so long endured through the ravages of the Great Boar. He declared
      that the thing, was intolerable, and that it only rested with themselves
      to put an end to it by a great <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link034" id="link034"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p034.jpg">034</a></span>and united
      effort. He professed himself willing to lead them if they would only
      engage to follow him, and was confident that, if he were obeyed, all would
      go well. If, indeed, they had any doubt about his being a fit person to
      lead them, let them only say so and he would at once yield to another.
      These words were received with much favour by many of his audience, but
      some of the more timid and doubtful still hesitated as to their course,
      when suddenly a voice spoke from the old oak in words of unmistakable
      import:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;This is the man and this the hour
To break the tyrant&rsquo;s hateful power.
No longer, Englishmen, delay;
Choose&mdash;listen&mdash;follow&mdash;and obey!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      These words at once reassured every one, and effectually settled the
      question. Smith was unanimously elected leader, and, like other leaders,
      proceeded at once to declare his policy. He told his followers that the
      first thing to be done was to make a good road right into the heart of the
      forest. People are apt to magnify dangers about which they know little,
      and the thick and impenetrable nature of the Boar&rsquo;s retreat greatly
      added to the idea of his wondrous power. The first thing, then, was to let
      the light of day in upon him, and, accordingly, the very next morning, a
      strong body of labourers commenced to work at a good, broad road, which
      should penetrate the heart of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this undertaking occupied some time, during which the secret
      interviews between Smith and the fair Druidess were not unfrequent, and
      the brave young leader obtained much good advice as to his mode of
      procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link035" id="link035"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p035.jpg">035</a></span>most
      extraordinary part of the story is that, all this time, no one heard or
      saw anything of the Boar. Whether he knew less of magic than was supposed,
      and, being engaged on the other side of the forest, did not know what was
      going on near Ascot Heath&mdash;or whether he knew and didn&rsquo;t think
      it worth while to interfere&mdash;or whether he was idle, sleepy, ill, or
      anything else&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know; but he never interfered at all
      until a long length of road had been made, and a gang of labourers had got
      very near his lair.

      Then, one fine morning, he rushed out with a number of his followers,
      ripping and goring right and left, and driving everything before him. It
      so happened that Smith was not with the workmen that day. Probably he had
      gone on some errand for the Druidess; but, however this may have been, the
      result was the same, and, in the absence of <span class="pagenum"><a

      href="../44425-page-images/p036.jpg">036</a></span>our hero, the
      Boar had it all his own way. In consequence of this triumph, the monster
      gave a great feast of hogwash and potatoes to all his subjects, and their
      grunting afterwards was so loud and horrible that it was remembered for a
      period of many years in the neighbourhood of Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith, as you may suppose, was thoroughly disgusted when he found what had
      occurred, and all the more so as he felt that his presence might, and
      probably would, have prevented the misfortune. Nothing daunted, however,
      he resolved to repair the mischief as quickly as possible. He sent far and
      wide throughout the country for all the white horses which could possibly
      be secured, and begged as many of their owners as felt martially inclined
      to accompany their steeds. This was done under the sage advice of the
      toads, to whom it was well known that to white animals beyond all others
      has been given the power of resisting the influences of magic arts. The
      knowledge that Smith&rsquo;s movement was supported by the Druids
      materially operated to promote the success of his request. From all
      quarters white horses and horsemen came flocking to the appointed place on
      Ascot Heath, and upon a certain day which he had fixed the leader found
      himself at the head of a numerous body of cavalry. He next proceeded to
      arm every man with a long wooden spear pointed with iron, and having given
      them their watchword and rallying cry, &ldquo;Bacon,&rdquo; marched boldly
      towards the forest. And now began the contest with the powers of magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boar sent forth his legions, having for the nonce converted hundreds
      of pigs into creatures bearing the form <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link037" id="link037"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p037.jpg">037</a></span>of man, whilst
      his own regiment of sharp-tusked boars acted as a reserve force in their
      own shape and form. They could not, however, prevail against the white
      army, protected by the wisdom of the toads and backed by the incantations
      of the saintly Druids. After a combat along the whole line which lasted
      for some hours, the magic forces of the Boar gave way on every side. Their
      resistance, indeed, stout and dogged as it had been at first, gave way at
      the sight of an enormous ham, boiled and ready for use, which at a
      critical moment of the contest was displayed by the orders of Smith at the
      top of a long pole. No porcine nature could withstand this spell, sure
      be-tokener of the fate of every vanquished and slaughtered pig. The
      enchanted animals (as the toads had privately told Smith would certainly
      be the case) resumed their natural shape by hundreds at the sight of this
      wondrous emblem, and fled with wild grunts into the forest, followed by
      the victorious army. On every side the white horsemen rode down the flying
      porkers, impaling them on their iron-tipped spears, and shouting &ldquo;Bacon&rdquo;
      until the forest rang again with the martial sound. Smith himself
      performed prodigies of valour, overthrowing and slaying numbers of the
      foe, and greatly assisting in bringing about the complete and terrible
      defeat which befell the forces of the Boar.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that towards eventide the battle was practically over, for not a
      pig but had resumed his natural shape, not a foe but had either fallen or
      fled into the deep recesses of the forest and sought safety in ignominious
      concealment from the face of day. Yet fast within his lair remained the
      Great Boar himself, and no one <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link038" id="link038"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p038.jpg">038</a></span>had as yet
      beheld him upon that day so fatal to his tribe. Why or wherefore he had
      not headed his troops is more than I can say. One would have supposed that
      his presence would have encouraged them, and that his continued seclusion
      within his lair must have been the most foolish proceeding on the part of
      the chief of an army who had so much at stake. But whatever reason he had,
      it is certain that he never appeared, and his people were slaughtered
      right and left without his ever coming to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith, however, was not to be treated in this manner by his mighty enemy.
      Unless the latter were dealt with in some satisfactory way, he knew well
      enough that his victory would have been all in vain, and that the evil
      with which his country had so long been afflicted would be by no means
      ended. He hesitated not, therefore, to push boldly forward into the heart
      of the forest, and seek the tyrant in his lair. The wood was uncommonly
      thick, and progress extremely difficult. Gigantic brambles formed an
      almost insuperable barrier, twining round the legs of the traveller in a
      manner remarkably disagreeable, and forming at certain places an almost
      impregnable network of defence. The bushes, too, grew thickly where the
      brambles did not, huge oaks stood about wherever there was any space clear
      from bush and bramble, strange weeds cropped up around, and altogether the
      place was as wild and difficult of access as you can well imagine. Yet
      Smith pushed bravely on, with some of his chosen companions, until he
      suddenly found himself in an open space some sixty feet square, almost
      entirely surrounded by oak-trees, plentifully encircled by ivy of the most
      luxuriant growth. As he entered <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link039" id="link039"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p039.jpg">039</a></span>this space, a
      deep voice uttered these words in terrible accents:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;How dares the child of loathsome toad.
Unasked to enter this abode?
No longer press thy childish whim,
Back! or I tear thee limb from limb.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The followers of the great deliverer were visibly staggered by these awful
      words, more especially as the speaker was nowhere to be seen. Smith
      himself, however, being perfectly prepared for some such proceeding on the
      part of his enemy, was not for a moment disconcerted in the smallest
      degree. By the advice of the powers which had directed and shielded him
      throughout the whole of his arduous enterprise, he had armed himself with
      an oaken staff, cut from a sacred tree which grew near to my banks, and
      which was held in peculiar estimation by the people. This staff, having
      been dipped in my river, and afterwards heavily tipped with lead, was a
      weapon of considerable power, and the gallant Smith brandished it on high
      above his head as he replied to his invisible enemy in the following
      words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Boast loud and long, thou villain Boar,
And trust in dealings magic;
More humbly shalt thou shortly roar,
And meet an ending tragic.

Come forth and try! I thee defy,
By mighty aid of Druid,
And this good staff, which lately I
Have dipt in Thames&rsquo;s fluid.

Come forth, I say! No more delay!
You rascal! what, you <i>won&rsquo;t</i> stir?
I brand thee, in the face of day,
A vile and hideous monster! &rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The words were scarcely out of his mouth, when a horrible <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link040" id="link040"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p040.jpg">040</a></span>noise between a
      grunt and a roar burst upon the ears of the attacking party, and the Great
      Boar of Windsor broke from his lair and rushed furiously upon his enemies.
      His eyes glared like fireballs&mdash;his bristles were erect and awful to
      see&mdash;his tusks seemed sharper and more enormous than any one would
      have supposed possible&mdash;and his whole appearance evinced such a
      mixture of strength and ferocity as might well have caused the stoutest
      heart to quail before his approach. Fury was in his countenance, and
      frightful was the expression of his face as he charged headlong down upon
      Smith, with a force which it seemed impossible to withstand. Uttering his
      war-cry in the shape of a suppressed but horrid grunt, he held his head
      low, and was evidently bent upon ripping up the intruder with the least
      possible delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be ripped up, however, was by no means Smith&rsquo;s intention.
      Springing hastily aside, he dealt the Boar a blow with his staff as he
      passed in the mad career which he was unable to check. The blow, dealt
      with the hero&rsquo;s full force upon the back of the monster&rsquo;s
      head, changed his grunt into a squeak of pain, but otherwise had no
      visible effect upon him. Rendered doubly furious by the failure of his
      first rush, the Boar now turned upon some of Smith&rsquo;s companions,
      upon whom he trusted to have wreaked an easy vengeance. But, with
      admirable sagacity, Smith had foreseen the possibility of such an
      occurrence, and, instructed by the toads, had carefully provided against
      it. Each of his followers who had entered the lair, besides being armed
      with spears as I have described, had in his hand a short stick upon the
      end of which was fastened a sausage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link041" id="link041"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p041.jpg">041</a></span>order given was,
      that, if the Boar attacked, this should simply be held out in front of the
      person in danger, which order you may well believe was faithfully obeyed.
      The effect was certainly marvellous. At the sight of each sausage the Boar&rsquo;s
      powers appeared to fail him, and he turned with a disappointed groan to
      find another victim. One man, indeed, found the protection useless, and
      was miserably ripped up and destroyed by the monster. A momentary panic
      prevailed, but it was fortunately remembered that the luckless individual
      had brought his own sausage from his own manufactory, and that sundry of
      his neighbours who had lost their cats had more than once thrown the
      darkest suspicion upon the character and quality of the article which he
      supplied. It is therefore probable that the virtue inherent in sausages
      made from the lawful animal was wanting in his case, and that he perished
      justly as a deceiver of his fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Boar could make no head against a body of men so well prepared for
      his assault. He foamed at the mouth&mdash;he roared&mdash;he grunted&mdash;he
      howled&mdash;he rushed madly to and fro&mdash;but all his efforts were
      useless. Then once more he turned himself round and rushed with a frantic
      force upon the leader of his foes. Smith was at that instant standing
      close to an oak-tree, and so sudden was the Boar&rsquo;s attack that he
      had barely time to avoid it by a vigorous spring which he made, catching
      as he did so a branch above his head, and swinging himself up out of harm&rsquo;s
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boar, meanwhile, unable to stop himself, rushed with great force
      against the tree. To his infinite surprise, and indeed to the astonishment
      of all who saw it, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link042" id="link042"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p042.jpg">042</a></span>hard surface of
      the oak yielded to his touch, his tusks penetrated the bark, and he
      remained there firm and fast, caught by the head and held as if by a vice.
      At the same moment a strain of sweet and solemn music burst upon the ears
      of those who were present, and from behind the oak-tree stepped the figure
      of the Priestess Bertha, clad as she had been on the previous occasion of
      her addressing the people, save that she wore upon her head a wreath of
      mistletoe, bright and glistening with berries. Walking up to the still
      struggling Boar, she calmly sat down upon him, just as if he had been a
      camp-stool, upon which he groaned audibly, but remained perfectly still.
      Then the Priestess proceeded to speak:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;The Boar is vanquished in the fight,
And ended is his former might.
Cursed by his yoke no more ye be,
But Windsor&rsquo;s children shall be free.

Yet be ye cautious, firm, and wise,
Or other foes may still arise,
And ye may scarcely yet escape
From boars in brute or human shape.

Still, good advice I give to you:
Be honest, loyal, just, and true;
Drink not the wine that tastes of cork;
Keep down the pigs by eating pork;

Love sausages (avoiding shams);
And don&rsquo;t forget to cure your hams.
So, if your lives are good and pure,
Your happiness shall be secure;

Windsor to high renown shall soar,
And ne&rsquo;er again be spoiled by boar.
Meanwhile, &rsquo;tis time I play my part,
And banish hence foul magic art!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then, slowly rising from her strange seat, and extending her arm high in
      the air above the miserable Boar, She began to mutter to herself in a low
      tone mystic words <span class="pagenum"><a name="link043" id="link043"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p043.jpg">043</a></span>of dark and
      wondrous import, which had all the more effect upon her hearers because
      nobody understood them. Presently she turned again to the listening army,
      and thus addressed the Boar, her countenance bearing a stern expression
      and her whole appearance being one of queenly dignity:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Foul beast! henceforth thy power is stayed,
Thy former vassals shall be free;
Thine art no more shall be displayed,
But Windsor Forest boarless be!

Yet must thou not this forest leave,
Or quit the place, alive or dead,
Whence thou hast caused the land to grieve,
And tears in oceans to be shed.

In altered form remaining here,
Receive, vile tyrant, this thy ban:
Be filled henceforth with timid fear,
And tremble at the sight of man.

Henceforth on roots and insects feed;
And yet, when nobler creatures die,
Be thou suspected of the deed,
A hated sight to keeper&rsquo;s eye!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She spoke; and as the words fell from her inspired lips, a wondrous and
      melancholy change came over the unhappy animal to whom they were
      addressed. His tusks fell off, his head diminished, his body grew smaller
      even while she was speaking, and, as she ceased, the once great Boar stood
      there in the presence of his enemies, neither more nor less than an
      unusually large hedgehog. Shouts of mingled joy and astonishment broke
      from the surrounding peasants as they perceived this highly satisfactory
      transformation taking place upon their dreaded foe. There he stood,
      trembling and shivering before them, furtively casting his eyes right and
      left as if in search of some hiding-place to which he <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link044" id="link044"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p044.jpg">044</a></span>might betake
      himself at once. Then, after a moment or two, he curled himself up after
      the general manner of hedgehogs into a round, impenetrable ball, a
      proceeding which evoked shouts of laughter from those who had lately
      trembled at his very glance, but who now felt the most supreme contempt
      for their vanquished enemy. As they stood and gazed upon him, the
      transformed animal presently unrolled himself again, and scuttled away as
      fast as he could among the dry leaves, making, with a new but natural
      instinct, for a place of concealment beneath the roots of the enormous
      trees which grew around the spot. And in fact, so far as this history
      concerns the Great Boar of Windsor, Brother Rhine, I might as well bring
      it to a close at once, for little more was ever heard of him. The blow
      struck at Boardom throughout the kingdom by the destruction of his power
      was very great, and the race gradually died away and became extinct. Not
      so by any means the hedgehogs, who from that time forth mightily increased
      all over England, and who down to the present day love to make it their
      boast that they are lineally descended from the Great Boar of Windsor. So
      proud of ancient ancestry are even the brute beasts of creation, aping
      that arrant fool, man, in this as well as sundry other follies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious to observe how exactly the prophecy of the Druidess has been
      fulfilled with regard to these hedgehogs. They live, as we know, upon
      roots and insects, and it has been over and over again demonstrated by
      learned naturalists that their physical formation is such as to preclude
      the possibility of their being carnivorous animals. But tell a gamekeeper
      this, and he will laugh you <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link045" id="link045"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p045.jpg">045</a></span>to scorn. The
      words of the Druidess have come true enough in this instance; and if a
      nest of eggs is found destroyed, or a young pheasant torn or slain, the
      hedgehog is declared to be the culprit, and his unhappy race is persecuted
      even unto death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradition says, however, that death has never fallen upon the Great Boar
      himself, or that if his body has really perished, as one would suppose to
      have been the case long ago, his spirit still haunts the locality which
      his power and his crimes rendered so celebrated in those days of yore.
      Certain it is, that if you happen to know the site of the Boar&rsquo;s
      lair, which of course I know, Brother Rhine, but which is hidden from the
      knowledge of all mortals save those favoured by Fairyland power, you may
      sometimes hear tidings of its former occupant. Wander forth on a clear
      moonlight night, hide yourself securely among the brushwood or behind the
      gigantic oaks which still exist, and you will see all that is left of the
      monster who was so long the scourge and terror of the place. A large
      hedgehog, bearing the weight of many years upon his back, will issue from
      beneath the roots of some of the old trees, followed by several smaller
      beings of the same species. Slowly and sadly he will creep, with feeble
      steps and decrepit gait, down the open space in front of the trees, and
      pass before you, uttering a low grunt of retrospective misery as he crawls
      over the altered scenes of his departed greatness. Move not; raise not a
      finger; keep entire silence; and as you gaze upon the unhappy wretch, let
      pity rather than scorn take possession of your heart; and when after his
      short walk he returns shaking with age and sorrow, and once more creeps
      into his humble hiding-place, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link046" id="link046"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p046.jpg">046</a></span>ponder over the
      shortness and instability of earthly power and wealth, and remember that
      you have beheld all that remains of that terrible being who was once so
      infamously notorious as the Great Boar of Windsor.

      But although I told you that, so far as the Boar was concerned, my story
      might very well have ended here, you cannot have listened to me with the
      attention which you have deigned to bestow without wishing to know
      something more of the fortunes of the other personages of whom I have
      spoken. As soon as the hedgehog had retired, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link047" id="link047"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p047.jpg">047</a></span>and their
      apprehensions were once and for all removed, the worthy peasants broke out
      into what is nowadays called a &ldquo;truly British cheer.&rdquo; While
      they did this, the Priestess Bertha took the opportunity of retiring into
      the forest, so that when the good people had cheered enough, and were
      getting rather hoarse, they found that she had disappeared. The whole of
      their attention, therefore, was concentrated upon Smith, whom they
      surrounded with expressions of the warmest gratitude, and overwhelmed with
      thanks for the ability, courage, and discretion which he had evinced in
      the conduct of the whole affair. Had it been a few centuries later, they
      would doubtless have presented him with the freedom of their city,
      supposing them to have had one. As it was, they could do little but thank
      him, and declare themselves anxious that he should be their chief, or
      king, or anything else he pleased. Smith, however, stood moodily aside,
      leaning upon his spear, and declined to accept the offered dignity. The
      people were still crowding around him and urging him to complete the good
      work which he had just begun, by ruling over those whom he had freed from
      an intolerable yoke, when an event took place which entirely changed the
      character of the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there appeared among the trees and amid the people a number of
      Druids, clad in the vestments which they habitually wore, and brandishing
      the weapons with which they usually perpetrated the sacrifices which
      accompanied their most solemn rites. Without more ado they proceeded to
      seize upon Smith, and declared to the astonished people that the gods had
      intimated their will that he should be immediately sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <span class="pagenum"><a name="link048" id="link048"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p048.jpg">048</a></span>was by no means
      welcome news to those who heard it, nor could they readily understand why
      the Druids should desire the life of one who had hitherto shown the
      greatest reverence for them and their religion, and who had, moreover,
      just rendered a great public service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murmurs began to arise from the crowd, murmurs deep and angry, to the
      effect that jealousy of Smith&rsquo;s influence was at the bottom of the
      movement, and that the Druids, who had never been able to get rid of the
      Boar until Smith had appeared on the scene, were ready to kill him out of
      the way as soon as ever he had accomplished the task which had been too
      much for themselves. Anxious to remove an impression which, if allowed to
      remain, might become the source of danger to their authority over the
      people, one of the chief Druids jumped upon the trunk of a fallen tree and
      begged leave to explain. This having been readily granted, the venerable
      man stated that the people ought to know by this time that reverend
      ecclesiastics never did anything wrong, and that mean or ignoble motives
      were never harboured in their holy hearts. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;although Smith had certainly rendered considerable
      service to the people (and this the Druids would be the last to deny), he
      had nullified all his claims to their gratitude by the commission of an
      offence which struck a deep blow at the very root of that religion which
      was the sole basis of their social order, and their only hope alike for
      the present and the future. He had ventured to speak of love to the holy
      Druidess Bertha, and there was every reason to believe that they were
      privately married!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At <span class="pagenum"><a name="link049" id="link049"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p049.jpg">049</a></span>these words a
      thrill of horror ran through the crowd, who had been taught to believe a
      Druidess to be a species of being superior to the ordinary feelings of
      mortals, and one to whom marriage should have been an entire
      impossibility. They dared offer no further opposition to the Druids, and
      were about to suffer their gallant defender and deliverer to be dragged
      away to a cruel death without further effort to save him. But all was not
      over yet. Smith had allies of whom his cowardly followers and his bigoted
      persecutors were alike ignorant. With a mighty effort he shook off the
      priests who held him, and in a stentorian voice shouted aloud the words of
      magic token, &ldquo;Help, oh, my Toddlekins!&rdquo; Scarce were the words
      out of his mouth when a toad of extraordinary size hopped from the forest
      into the open space, and looked around with eyes that sparkled with angry
      indignation. At the sight of him the Druids felt their hearts fail; their
      arms dropped by their sides, their weapons fell from their hands, and they
      lacked alike the will and the power to harm their intended victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the toad who had been adjured under the name of Toddlekins gave
      a jerk with his legs right and left, shook off his toad-skin, and appeared
      in the shape of a young man of singularly prepossessing appearance. His
      form was tall and manly, his beautifully shaped head was covered with dark
      hair, and the remarkably sweet expression of his countenance was enhanced
      by the extraordinary beauty and brightness of his eyes. Looking about him
      right and left, and waving his hand in a careless manner, he addressed the
      people as follows: &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will
      excuse me for making the remark that you are a set of very particular
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link050" id="link050"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p050.jpg">050</a></span>fools. In order
      to convince you that I have a right to say this, I will tell you with
      plain brevity who and what <i>I</i> am. I was born, never mind when or
      where, into this world, and being found in all respects much too good for
      it, the Fates decided that I should wait for a certain number of centuries
      before I again came into it as a mortal, and should meanwhile pass my time
      as a powerful fairy. As such I have lived in Toadland for some time past,
      and have especially watched over the education of my friend Smith. That is
      all I shall tell you about myself, except that my power has aided you to
      achieve your freedom, and will now prevent you from suffering a crime to
      be perpetrated which would disgrace you for ever. But I have something
      more to tell you about the person called Smith. He is one for whom I
      cherish a particular regard, and you ought to do the same. For has he not
      delivered you from your ancient enemy? But he has done more. The very
      crime of which he is accused, if crime it be, has been done in <i>your</i>
      service. He has fulfilled the old proverb, which it was necessary to do
      before the Boar&rsquo;s power could be destroyed. This proverb declared
      that the blood of the &lsquo;slayer and the slain&rsquo; must be blended
      together before the Boar&rsquo;s reign should cease. Do you ask how this
      has been done? I will read you the riddle. The father of the Priestess
      Bertha was none other than an old Druid who sacrificed (most improperly)
      the male parent of my friend Smith. He had no right to a daughter at all,
      but of this I will say nothing except that the holy maiden has possession
      of the very spectacles which he always wore on sacrificing days, and which
      he bestowed upon her at his death, conveying <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link051" id="link051"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p051.jpg">051</a></span>to her at the
      same time the information respecting her birth which I have just given
      you. Thus, then, the blood of the slayer and slain have been blended
      together by the marriage of the daughter of the former with the son of the
      latter. The Boar has consequently been got rid of, and unless you are the
      most ungrateful set of varlets that ever breathed, you will tell the
      Druids to go home and mind their own business, will celebrate the nuptials
      of the happy couple by a jolly good dinner, and break up at the close of
      the evening with &lsquo;three cheers for Smith!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech of the fairy Toddlekins was received with rapturous applause
      by every one present, especially the closing allusion to a &ldquo;jolly
      good dinner,&rdquo; which in every age has had a decided attraction for
      Englishmen. The Druids, who were wise in their generation, at once
      determined not to risk the loss of their influence by further opposition
      to that which was evidently the popular will, and was moreover supported
      by the powers of Fairyland. So, determined to make the best of it without
      further delay, they pretended to have been entirely convinced by the
      speech they had just heard, and not only joined in the cheers which
      greeted its conclusion, but volunteered to stand the dinner into the
      bargain! They proceeded to do still more; within an incredibly short space
      of time they fetched Bertha (who had previously stood no inconsiderable
      chance of being sacrificed too), and presented her and Smith together
      before the fairy youth for his approving benediction. This, as you may
      easily suppose, was freely and kindly given.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hardly think I need tell you any more. Smith still declined <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link052" id="link052"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p052.jpg">052</a></span>to reign over
      the people, and, considering the experience he had had of their fickle
      nature, I don&rsquo;t think he was far wrong. Nor do I deem him to have
      erred in his determination to leave that particular neighbourhood, being
      under the belief that when holy men have once intended to sacrifice a
      fellow, they are never very safe customers for him afterwards. So the
      happy couple very soon departed from Windsor, and I know very little more
      about them except that their family is not extinct at the present day, and
      is by no means likely to become so. I believe they lived very happily, and
      I never heard of any unpleasantness between them. Still I confess that, if
      I had been Smith, I should have been afraid to marry a woman who could
      change a boar into a hedgehog, lest at any time she should take it into
      her head to exercise her powers upon her husband in a manner which might
      have been inconvenient, to say the least of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am scarcely in a position to tell you whether the fairy Toddlekins has
      ever left Toadland again and come once more upon earth as a mortal. I
      might make a guess, Brother Rhine, if I chose, even at <i>this</i>, but
      perhaps I had better be silent. Many a pleasant youthful face, worthy of
      Fairyland, frequents my waters at times, and the old college of Eton has
      sent me such over and over again. But if I should single out any
      particular face and form, and declare to the astonished world that therein
      I recognised the noble fairy Toddlekins of the Druid times, I don&rsquo;t
      suppose anybody would believe me; and even you, Brother Rhine, might think
      it possible that I was mistaken. So now I have finished my legend, and as
      I see that you <span class="pagenum"><a name="link053" id="link053"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p053.jpg">053</a></span>have not
      neglected your flagon of wine meanwhile, I hope that you have derived
      therefrom sufficient inspiration to be able to give me a tale of your own
      fair country which shall eclipse in interest the account which I have
      ventured to give you of the Great Boar of Windsor!
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Father Thames had thus concluded his story, his companion
      clapped his hands in an approving manner. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he remarked,
      &ldquo;is a capital legend, and ends, as a legend should, in a comfortable
      manner. I have many curious tales of my own river, but none, I think, more
      curious than the one you have related. However, as it is now my turn, I
      will do my best, and, with your good leave, will tell you the famous story
      of 'Martha&rsquo;s Vengeance.&rsquo;&rdquo;

      MARTHA&rsquo;S VENGEANCE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Baroness Von
      Bandelboots was a woman of an awful temper. Her husband trembled before
      her, her servants hardly felt that their souls were their own when she
      spoke, the vassals of the Bandelboots estates shivered in their shoes when
      they met her, and the neighbours all kept out of her way as much as
      possible. And yet there was no reason why this lady should have been so
      violent and have made herself and others so miserable! You would have
      thought she had everything to content her. The husband, good easy man, let
      her do just as she liked, and cared nothing for her indulgence <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link054" id="link054"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p054.jpg">054</a></span>of all her whims
      and fancies, so long as he was secure of his favourite pipe and his
      comfortable armchair after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had several daughters of various ages who had never caused her a
      moment&rsquo;s uneasiness, and after some years of anxious expectation a
      son had been bom who would in due course of time succeed to the honours of
      the family, and who meanwhile was, naturally enough, the legitimate object
      of her maternal devotion. Moreover, the Baroness lacked not riches. Not
      only were the estates of the Baron large and productive around his castle
      on the Rhine, but he had other distant property which brought him in no
      inconsiderable revenue, and he readily gave to his beloved wife control
      over wealth sufficient to have contented the most extravagant of females.
      Besides this, she had a house which was really charming, built upon an
      island in the middle of a lake, only a short distance from my beloved
      river, and furnished with everything that good taste could support and a
      full purse supply. Nor was she without neighbours, even in a country
      wherein neighbours are generally scarce. Several other castles stood
      within driving distance of the Bandelboots domain, and the Baroness could
      with very little exertion procure for herself society, if society she
      desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the good dame&rsquo;s temper was a curse to herself and
      everybody she came near, and she seemed to delight in scolding for
      scolding&rsquo;s sake. This unfortunate propensity had been productive of
      much discomfort and inconvenience to the Baron&rsquo;s household, even
      before the particular events which I am about to relate. Several old and
      valuable servants had left, either having been <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link055" id="link055"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p055.jpg">055</a></span>dismissed by the
      Baroness in moments of passion, or having found themselves unable to stay
      consistently with their self-respect, after having been subjected to the
      strong language which she frequently used upon such occasions, which was,
      I am sorry to say, more than once followed by personal violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      One servant she had indeed retained for several years, and this was her
      own maid, Martha Scweinvolt. This woman was one of a singularly
      unprepossessing appearance, and of a certain age. Her nose was long and
      somewhat like a hook, her forehead receded in a strange angle immediately
      above her eyebrows, her ears were remarkably large and low down on her
      head, her chin protruded, her neck was of unnatural length, her hands and
      feet larger than those of ordinary women, and her figure tall, lank, and
      ungainly. To such a person did the Baroness entrust the care of her
      wardrobe and the adorning of her noble self; and although she frequently
      indulged her with a good scolding, the maid received it all with stolid
      indifference, perhaps because, as her vinegar aspect seemed to denote, she
      herself could be cross upon occasions, and thought it not unreasonable
      that her mistress should be the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day it chanced, indeed, that the kettle, so to speak, boiled over.
      Martha Scweinvolt had been engaged upon her mistress&rsquo;s back hair,
      and the latter, seated in &ldquo;demi-toilette&rdquo; upon a low stool,
      had been reading a novel. Suddenly she took it into her head to drop the
      book and take up a small hand looking-glass to see how her maid was
      getting on. In so doing she made a forward movement, which, as Martha
      happened at that instant to have the hair tight in hand, had the <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link056" id="link056"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p056.jpg">056</a></span>natural effect
      of making the lady feel as if her maid had suddenly given her hair a
      violent and unpleasant pull. Without for a moment considering that it was
      entirely her own fault, the Baroness directly flew into a most furious
      passion. She stormed and raved against the woman until she was almost
      black in the face, and then, to finish matters off, struck her with either
      hand a violent box on the ears on each side of her head, and hustled her
      out of the room as if she was more than half inclined to kick her
      down-stairs then and there.

    </h4>
    <p>
      Once outside the door, Martha Scweinvolt became perfectly livid with rage.
      She turned round on the top of the stairs, faced the Baroness&rsquo;s
      room, and shook her fist <span class="pagenum"><a name="link057"
      id="link057"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p057.jpg">057</a></span>vehemently
      towards it, vowing by her eleven-o&rsquo;clock bread and cheese and beer
      (the most solemn oath known among domestic servants of the feminine
      gender) that she would have her revenge. Nor was Martha a person by any
      means likely to forget or neglect such a vow. Day and night she brooded
      over the matter, and ground her teeth savagely together as she remembered
      the indignity to which she had been subjected. And the more she brooded,
      the more determined did she become to seek vengeance from some quarter
      whence it could be surely and safely obtained. By herself she knew she
      could do but little; and as she was by no means popular among the other
      servants of the household, she could place but little reliance on any
      assistance from them. How to proceed, therefore, she had great doubts, but
      to proceed in some manner she was quite determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now unfortunately for me, Brother Thames, as you may perhaps be aware, a
      part of my stream has always been more or less under the influence of a
      class of river demons from which you in England are happily free. I
      believe a milder kind of demon exists in Scotland under the name of water
      kelpie, and possibly there may be something of the sort here and there
      even in your favoured English rivers, but you have nothing to match the
      demons of the Rhine. It is not a theme upon which I love to dwell. No
      respectable river desires to have anything to do with such creatures, and
      I frankly confess that at times they have brought my waters into great
      disrepute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well (or rather not at all &ldquo;well,&rdquo; according to my view of the
      case), it happened that the Rhine near the castle of the Baron von
      Bandelboots was terribly infested <span class="pagenum"><a name="link058"
      id="link058"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p058.jpg">058</a></span>by
      these noxious spirits, only too ready at all times to do any mischief in
      their power to any human being, or to assist one mortal in gratifying his
      or her malice against another. To these demons did Martha Scweinvolt
      determine to appeal, and made up her mind to risk, if necessary, body and
      soul in order to obtain vengeance upon her hated mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very often I am able to prevent the wicked plans and machinations of these
      spirits, and I never fail to do so if I can manage it. If things had gone
      rightly, I should have stopped the affair of which I am about to tell you,
      and nipped it in the bud if possible, either by overflowing my banks
      suddenly and drowning the wretch Martha, or by some other means which my
      knowledge of the world would have enabled me to provide. But it most
      unfortunately happened that the nymphs and trolls and friendly elves of
      the river and forests near had given me an entertainment that very
      evening, at which they played me several very curious tricks. The jovial
      rascals insisted on my drinking my Steinbergh in large pint measures, so
      that I got rather more than my usual allowance; then they fastened a huge
      white beard upon my chin, pulled my whiskers, combed my hair, whispered
      soft things in my ear, climbed on my knees, and altogether kept me so well
      amused, that I never went out at all that evening to patrol the river
      banks, according to my usual habit, and was therefore entirely ignorant of
      all that occurred, until I was told it some time after by a member of the
      Rhine Conservancy Board, who had it from good authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      It. seems that Martha Scweinvolt, having gone out late <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link059" id="link059"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p059.jpg">059</a></span>that evening,
      wandered down to the river, and there prayed vehemently to the demons for
      aid. Such prayers are hardly necessary to procure the assistance of bad
      spirits, when their object is to do mischief to somebody else.

    <p>
      A demon, therefore, who happened to be near the spot, forthwith presented
      himself to the waiting-maid, and that so suddenly that she fainted away
      immediately. Demons, however, being very skilful in the ways of women,
      know perfectly well that the best way to ensure their speedy recovery in
      such cases is to take no notice whatever of their proceeding. The evil
      spirit, therefore, followed this sensible plan, and waited patiently until
      Martha &ldquo;came to,&rdquo; when he politely inquired <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link060" id="link060"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p060.jpg">060</a></span>what her wishes
      might be and what service he could render.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman unfolded her grievance, and used several bad expressions with
      regard to her mistress, which caused her companion to grin with
      sympathetic pleasure. He then inquired what revenge she desired to take;
      to which Martha replied that she should like to have the power given her
      of inflicting severe personal chastisement upon the Baroness. But the
      demon scouted the idea. The pride of birth and rank work too much good to
      the objects which are dear to evil spirits to make them partial to any
      plan for the degradation of either one or the other, and such a
      degradation would have been inflicted had the well-born Baroness been
      subjected to personal chastisement at the hands of her menial. Besides
      this, the power of the demon was but limited, and this would have been
      possibly beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha suggested several other things, but at length she broke out in
      joyful tones, as if an unusually bright idea had suddenly struck her:
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do something to the
      child, the young Baron Hubert. Strangle him, or lame him for life, or make
      him humpbacked; that will wring her old heart-strings!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing these words, the demon, who was a decent fellow at bottom,
      though withal up to any mischief of a reasonable kind, positively
      shuddered at the bitterness of the waiting-maid&rsquo;s speech,
      accompanied as it was with a look of fiendish exultation which would have
      done credit to the worst of devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a bit, miss, stop a bit,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Fair and
      softly wins the race; you go too fast, and want too much, all at once. You
      must know that we demons cannot do everything <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link061" id="link061"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p061.jpg">061</a></span>just how and
      when, we please, as you seem to imagine. Not a bit of it! Fortunately for
      mortals who have enemies (and who has not?) our power is limited; and even
      suppose you had the child with you at this moment, I could not do what you
      require.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; exclaimed Martha angrily, &ldquo;what in the name of
      goodness <i>can</i> you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the demon shuddered visibly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use such
      language, young lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you want <i>my</i> help,
      but listen attentively to what I am about to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Much flattered at being called a young lady, and probably all the more so
      from her knowledge that to neither the substantive nor the adjective had
      she any right whatever, Martha bent her head forward eagerly, to hear what
      the water-demon had to suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I can change the child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change the child!&rdquo; cried the disappointed woman; &ldquo;why,
      what would be the good of <i>that?</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the good in the world,&rdquo; replied her counsellor, &ldquo;if
      you really wish to plague the mother. In the first place, the child I
      shall put in the place of the young Baron will not be nearly so pretty as
      the real child, and this will gall the mother&rsquo;s heart not a little,
      unless baronesses are unlike other women. Then this false child will have
      a very much worse disposition. He will be cunning, ill-natured, greedy,
      mischievous, and a plague to the whole household.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce he will!&rdquo; cried Martha hurriedly. &ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t
      plague <i>me</i>, will he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better language by a good deal, my dear,&rdquo; rejoined the demon,
      smiling good-humouredly at the exclamation <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link062" id="link062"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p062.jpg">062</a></span>of his
      companion; &ldquo;but as to the inquiry you make, I can hardly reply.
      Should the little changeling, however, prove any annoyance even to
      yourself, I am sure you would willingly submit thereto in consideration of
      the glorious revenge which you will wreak upon the wretched mother. Why,
      your poor ears must even now be tingling from the effects of those
      shameful slaps, and, if I were in your place, it would be long enough
      before I forgot them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Mr. Demon,&rdquo; answered the maid,
      gnashing her teeth fiercely as she spoke. &ldquo;I am not one to forget or
      forgive either, and, after all, a child can&rsquo;t really annoy me much.
      I&rsquo;ll risk it, anyhow, so that my brute of a mistress is made to
      suffer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my brave girl,&rdquo; merrily replied her
      friend, smiling with as pleasant a look as he knew how to put on. &ldquo;That
      shows the true spirit of a German lady. Never fear, you shall have your
      revenge, and that speedily.&rdquo; Thereupon he commenced a series of
      questions as to the habits of the household and the rooms which were
      occupied by the youthful Baron, and having ascertained all the particulars
      which he required, bade Martha Scweinvolt return home, and rest assured
      that her desire should be accomplished upon the innocent baby, and his
      mother made to rue bitterly the hour when she first laid hands upon her
      waiting-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha departed, having, I suppose, in the first instance given some such
      pledge to the demon as these creatures are in the habit of exacting from
      those who seek their good offices, which usually consists of a simple
      arrangement regarding their future which they have no power whatever to
      make, and which may hereafter <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link063" id="link063"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p063.jpg">063</a></span>be set aside on
      an appeal to the proper tribunal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the Baroness von Bandelboots had not the slightest suspicion of
      the calamity which was hanging over herself and her family. She ate,
      drank, slept, and scolded after her usual fashion, and did not alter her
      behaviour one whit after the adventure with her waiting-maid, which had so
      painfully affected the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Baron Hubert was but a few months old, and his nurse, Sophie
      Grutchen, had the sole charge of his precious person. His nursery was, as
      luck would have it, on the side of the castle facing the river; but I
      apprehend that to demons and creatures of that description the situation
      of the apartment would have made but little difference, and indeed there
      was the lake to cross in any case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one evening the demon set out to fulfil his promise. He swam the
      lake, climbed the wall of the castle, entered the room in which the young
      Baron slept by the window, and, during the scarcely more than momentary
      absence of the nurse, abstracted the baby from his cot, deposited therein
      an elfin child of the same size, and departed with the real baby by the
      same way he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the little Baron had, from his first entrance into the world, been
      distinguished by his remarkably docile and tractable nature. He rarely
      cried, never fretted, and was, in consequence, a general pet, so far as
      such a term can be applied to an infant of such tender age. Within an hour
      or two, however, after the occurrence which I have just related, Mother
      Grutchen began to find <span class="pagenum"><a name="link064" id="link064"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p064.jpg">064</a></span>her charge less
      quiet and more troublesome than had previously been the case. She
      forthwith reported the fact to the Baroness, who, however, took her to
      task sharply for the same, saying that it was all fancy, and that the dear
      child was a little angel. This the poor nurse by no means wished to deny,
      but it entered her head that there were different kinds of angels, and
      that vowed <span class="pagenum"><a name="link065" id="link065"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p065.jpg">065</a></span>and declared
      that this was not the right child.
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p>
      This was an unpleasant and curious exclamation, and put Mother Grutchen in
      a terrible flurry. She owned that she thought the young Baron looked
      rather queer, but remarked that babies varied considerably from time to
      time; and, moreover, that as she had scarcely had him out of her sight
      since the day he was born, he could not by any possibility be anything
      else than the young Baron. Still the Baroness held to her opinion, and
      even some of these might occasionally be troublesome. She determined
      faithfully to do her duty by the child nevertheless, and to make no more
      complaints to her mistress. The latter was not slow, however, to find out
      that something was amiss with the infant. The very next morning, when it
      was brought to her, she looked at it with a strange and startled
      expression, and declared that it was not her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this the Baron was appealed to at once. He, poor man, was terribly
      annoyed at being asked the question. Proud as he had been from the first
      of his infant son, he was one of those who held the theory that all babies
      are, up to a certain age, very much alike, and was positively quite
      incapable of pronouncing upon the identity of his own child. He put on his
      large gold-rimmed spectacles, stared vacantly down upon the infant, and
      said several things which had nothing whatever to do with the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      This put the Baroness in a passion, which by no means mended matters at
      all, and there seemed every probability of a general row. But Martha
      Scweinvolt, who had been hovering about the door, waiting to be summoned,
      now found an excuse for entering the room, and so strongly expressed her
      decided belief and conviction that the child was the right child, and none
      other, that the good nurse felt her own opinion coming more strongly to
      the same conclusion. The Baron, for very peace and quietness, agreed with
      the two servants; and the Baroness, finding them all against her, had a
      regular good scold all round, and said no more about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came to pass, Brother Thames, that the child Hubert was carried
      off by the water-demon, and a wretched little changeling put in his place
      and accepted as the young heir. It was not long before his evil
      propensities began to develop themselves. He could scarcely walk alone
      before he was in mischief, and, indeed, long before this time he knocked
      over his mother&rsquo;s morning cup of tea whenever he could manage to do
      so in <span class="pagenum"><a name="link066" id="link066"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p066.jpg">066</a></span>his early visits
      to her bed, and scratched the Baron&rsquo;s face, as he lay asleep, with a
      tiny fist which seemed hardly capable of hurting so much as it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew fast for a short time, and then remained as if he would never grow
      any bigger. But his appetite was more like that of a full-grown man, nor
      was he particular where or what he ate. At breakfast he would finish off a
      huge bowl of porridge, and make his old nurse tilt over the bowl so that
      he might lick off the last drop from the edge. He would clutch at
      everything on the dining-room table if brought in during meals, and roar
      and cry loudly if the things he wanted were not immediately given to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he grew older, his conduct by no means improved. Not only was he
      abominably rude to his supposed father and mother, but he took every
      opportunity of endeavouring to make them fall out. He would, with an utter
      disregard of truth, but with a wonderful air of innocence, tell the
      Baroness how he had heard the Baron say she had a bad temper, and was a
      disagreeable woman; whilst he would tell the Baron, as an affair of
      everyday occurrence, that his wife spoke of him as a lazy sot, who was no
      companion whatever to her, and spent his life in eating, drinking, and
      smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      These little things were scarcely calculated to improve the happiness of
      the worthy couple, but this was by no means the only channel through which
      the little wretch poured discomfort upon the household. He set everybody
      by the ears whenever he could, and showed an utter heartlessness of
      character, coupled with a reckless depravity of disposition, which was
      perfectly horrible. He roared with laughter on being told of any
      misfortune having <span class="pagenum"><a name="link067" id="link067"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p067.jpg">067</a></span>happened to
      another person, and scowled sulkily when any one fell in with a piece of
      good luck. Crushing flies on the windows was one of his earliest
      amusements, and when this had become monotonous, he used to torture any
      animal he could get hold of with a cruelty beyond belief.

      He would stick pins in his pony&rsquo;s neck to <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link068" id="link068"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p068.jpg">068</a></span>make it dance,
      as he said, and indulge in screams of laughter at its suffering. He
      snipped off his dog&rsquo;s ears with a sharp pair of scissors, put the
      house-cat into the copper full of boiling water until its yells brought
      the cook to save it, and loved better than anything to get hold of some of
      the skewers out of the kitchen, in order to impale upon them any
      unfortunate mouse which he could find in the traps.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any visitor came to the castle, he was fortunate indeed if he escaped
      unhurt. The little wretch began upon him as soon as he entered the house,
      creeping slyly behind him in order to cut off the buttons of his coat,
      give him a cruel pinch when least expected, and even sometimes went the
      length of running a pin into his leg. And when the unhappy gentleman rose
      to depart, if he did not find his coat-tails tied fast to the chair, ten
      to one but he was tripped up, as he ran down the stairs, by a thin but
      strong string, tied ankle-high by the young Baron about half-way down,
      nearly sure to produce a most awkward fall, the annoyance of which was
      increased by the triumphant and insulting chuckle of the little villain,
      who, perched on the highest step, or peeping through the banisters above,
      would watch with eager delight to witness the effects of his wicked trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not surprising that the young rascal was cordially detested
      throughout the whole household. Indeed, they had small cause to do
      anything else but detest him. There was no trouble he did not give the
      servants, and no trick which he did not play them. If he met the
      housemaids on the stairs or in the passages he invariably blew out their
      candles, or ran hastily against them, as if <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link069" id="link069"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p069.jpg">069</a></span>by accident, so
      as if possible to make them drop any tray or jug they might be carrying.
      He rang the bell constantly for nothing, and pointed and laughed at the
      footman who came hurrying to answer it. He turned the lamp-oil into the
      soup just as the cook was about to send it up for the Baron&rsquo;s
      dinner, put a quantity of vinegar into the beer which the butler had
      carefully drawn for the &ldquo;hall&rdquo; supper, and smeared the groom
      of the chamber&rsquo;s chair in &ldquo;the room&rdquo; so thickly with
      bird-lime, that the respected individual in question had the greatest
      difficulty in ever getting out of it again. In short, he became the
      torment of the house, and everybody wished most devoutly that he had never
      been born.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only consolation was that, somehow or other, he selected Martha
      Scweinvolt as his principal victim. That woman&rsquo;s life became a
      burden to her. Her thimble was constantly missing, and, when put on
      hastily, was more than once full of tar or glue, cunningly placed therein
      by the malicious urchin. &ldquo;Booby-traps&rdquo; were constantly set for
      her, in the shape of heavy books or jugs of water skilfully balanced on
      the top of the door of the Baroness&rsquo;s room, which was then left just
      ajar, and the bell hastily rung, so that, coming down-stairs and entering
      the apartment in a hurry, she was sure to get the benefit of the jug or
      books upon her devoted head. These tricks, however, were by no means his
      worst. The supposed young Baron, in his visits to the housekeeper&rsquo;s
      room, never missed the chance of paying attention to Martha&rsquo;s
      comfort after his own peculiar fashion. He put salt in her beer when her
      head was turned; slyly inserted needles in her bread, which more than
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link070" id="link070"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p070.jpg">070</a></span>once proved
      nearly fatal to the woman; and upon one occasion doctored her tea with
      some drugs which he had abstracted from his mother&rsquo;s medicine-chest,
      and which produced serious and most unpleasant results. Not content with
      these practical jokes, the urchin never spared the feelings of anybody,
      and Martha was oftentimes almost goaded to madness by his insulting
      remarks upon her personal appearance, disposition, and situation in life.
      As time went on, matters seemed to get rather worse than better, and the
      wretched woman experienced to her cost that revenge, sweet as it may be,
      cannot be purchased without a heavy sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these things were passing in the castle of Bandelboots, the question
      may not unnaturally be asked of me what had become of the real child, the
      unfortunate young Hubert, who had been carried away by the river-demon. It
      may easily be supposed that his was no pleasant fate. Fortunately for him,
      those who had taken him from his happy home had no power either to kill or
      injure him, neither could they alter the goodness of his natural
      disposition. The latter, however, rendered his condition somewhat more
      uncomfortable than would otherwise have been the case, for being forced to
      consort with witches, demons, imps, and other low and disreputable
      society, he was constantly brought into contact with many things and
      people most disagreeable and revolting to anything pure and good. He was
      obliged to attend the &ldquo;bad language class&rdquo; of the water-imps,
      where prizes were given for swearing and wicked conversation; the art of
      tormenting was taught him by an elderly demon, to whom the task was
      congenial; and general instruction in devilry was afforded him <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link071" id="link071"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p071.jpg">071</a></span>by means of
      public lectures delivered by a spirit specially appointed for the purpose.
      Such, however, was his natural goodness, that he steadily refused to be
      perverted, maintaining a dignified silence amid the jesting and ribaldry
      of the imps around, and invariably declining to join in any of their
      misconduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that the demons could do, under the circumstances, was to alter,
      without permanently injuring, the form with which he had entered the
      world. This they did by giving to his well-shaped body the appearance of a
      round and ill-made bulk, upon which they placed a bullet-head with a pair
      of short horns over the forehead, and ornamented it, moreover, with a long
      tail and a pair of bat&rsquo;s wings. Thus being changed into a regular
      little devilet, it was marvellous that the boy should have continued to
      preserve the goodness and purity of his disposition. So it was, however;
      and as demons who live by tempting mortals to sin have a very large field
      over which to practise their skill, and cannot afford to devote to any one
      individual more than a fair share of their attention, they got tired after
      a while of trying it on with the young Baron, and ended by leaving him
      very much to himself. Then it was that the boy found amusement in flying
      about along the banks of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the mysterious laws of magic, he knew, and yet did not know, the
      misfortune which had befallen him, and the crime of which he had been made
      the victim. In other words, he knew that something was as it should not
      be, and that, somehow or other, he had been cruelly wronged, but of the
      exact nature of the wrong he was as yet ignorant. Still, some instinct led
      him to the lake in which was situated the island upon which stood his
      father&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum"><a name="link072" id="link072"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p072.jpg">072</a></span>castle, and he
      loved better than anything else to fly by night round and round the old
      place, uttering from time to time mournful cries, which now and then found
      their way to the ears of some of the Baron&rsquo;s household. Whenever the
      false heir heard these sounds, it was noticed that he, shivered terribly,
      and crept, groaning and growling; under the nearest sofa, or anywhere out
      of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And upon one occasion, when the cry sounded louder and clearer than usual,
      and there came a noise as if a wing&mdash;had flapped against window of
      the state-room in which the family were assembled that evening, he howled
      miserably, the ground, and almost went into convulsions with alarm.

    <p>
      This behaviour on the part of his supposed son struck the Baron as
      strange, and was, indeed, the cause of some coldness between him and his
      wife. For, being a man somewhat proud of the chivalry and courage of his
      high ancestry, this display of cowardice on the part of his <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link073" id="link073"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p073.jpg">073</a></span>probable heir
      and successor greatly irritated the old gentleman, and he boldly declared
      that he was sure it all came from the mother&rsquo;s side. Such an
      accusation naturally put the Baroness into one of her passions, in the
      course of which she went so far as to pull off her husband&rsquo;s wig and
      slap his cheeks. This indignity was one to which the Baron could scarcely
      be expected to submit, and having soundly shaken his respected consort, he
      left the room in high dudgeon, and took his meals alone for the next three
      days, which annoyed the Baroness more than anything else, as it left her
      only her daughters and servants to scold, which had become rather insipid.
      After a while this conduct of the child was set down to constitutional
      timidity, and the Baron only smiled contemptuously when it was repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      So time wore on, and it really seemed as if there was no reason why the
      truth should ever be discovered, or the success of Martha Scweinvolt&rsquo;s
      wicked scheme be otherwise than complete. It was not, however, wholly
      satisfactory to the waiting-maid herself, for, independently of the
      unpleasant behaviour of the false heir towards her, she had not even the
      satisfaction of seeing her mistress suffer as she had hoped. So it is that
      people who consult demons, or, what is nearly as bad, follow the dictates
      of their own evil passions, are generally deceived in the result, and find
      that the good to themselves which they expected to obtain pretty certainly
      ends in disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the Baroness had at first declared that the child brought to her
      by Sophie Grutchen on that eventful morning was not her own, she had
      become reconciled to the state of things in a marvellously short <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link074" id="link074"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p074.jpg">074</a></span>time, fancied
      that, after all, she must have been under some delusion, and in a very few
      days took kindly to the infant. As he grew up, her fondness for him
      increased, and, in spite of what has been so often said and written about
      the unfailing instinct of a mother, she firmly believed him to be her own
      son. Instead, therefore, of her heart-strings being wrung, as Martha had
      charitably hoped would have been the case, she was by no means unhappy.
      True it is, she suffered somewhat from the urchin&rsquo;s behaviour, but,
      when it did not happen to affect her own personal comfort, she took his
      part against the complaints of others, stood up for him when the Baron
      found fault, and scarcely ever endeavoured to check him in his mischievous
      and tormenting ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did Martha find that she had brought a plague upon herself without
      really securing her revenge, and that the only person who had been
      punished was the innocent child against whom she had borne no grudge. This
      was by no means a pleasant reflection, and in some natures would have
      produced a repentance for the evil done, and a sincere desire to undo it
      if possible. I regret to be obliged to state that this was by no means the
      case with Martha. On the contrary, her desire for revenge was unappeased,
      and the more she discovered that she had failed, the more she resolved
      that she would, somehow or other, ultimately succeed. With this view,
      therefore, she once more sought the river side, and summoned to her aid
      her former friend the water-demon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was nothing attractive in her appearance, or delightful in her
      society, the demon, who knew moreover <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link075" id="link075"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p075.jpg">075</a></span>that his hold
      upon her was sufficiently secure to make it a matter of indifference to
      him whether she committed any more crimes or not, did not come until she
      had adjured him by many entreaties and employed all the incantations of
      which she was the mistress. When at last he appeared, he treated her with
      contemptuous coldness, and derided her complaints that she had not enjoyed
      her promised revenge. In fact he told her, in so many words, that he had
      fulfilled his part of the bargain, and that she had no business to trouble
      him any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people would have taken this for a final answer, but Martha was not
      disposed to be put off after such a fashion. She told the demon that she
      was quite ready to own that he had done what he had promised, although the
      result had not been so satisfactory as she had been led to expect. She
      had, however, another plan, in which she required his assistance, and put
      it plainly to him, as a well-bred devil, whether he could refuse a lady
      under the peculiar circumstances of the case. Besides, she said, there
      would be crime committed by other persons, and possibly misery to many, if
      her plan could be carried out, and these should be powerful inducements to
      any right-minded demon, who understood the interests of his class, to
      render his willing and active assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her plan, then, was to stir up the neighbouring peasants and shepherds to
      revolt against the Baron. By constantly dinning into their ears stories of
      the lazy and useless life he led, and the abominable temper and tyranny of
      the Baroness, Martha had little doubt that a spirit of disaffection might
      be excited among these ignorant <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link076" id="link076"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p076.jpg">076</a></span>people which she
      would eventually be able to turn to good account. If she could induce them
      to rise against the Baron, and suddenly attack the castle, she would take
      good care that the Baroness should not escape; and even if the movement
      was not successful, she would be able in the confusion to wreak her
      revenge, by dagger or poison, upon her hated mistress. Such an attempt, in
      any case, could not fail to be productive of much evil and discomfort to
      one side or the other, and must, therefore, be a scheme which should at
      once recommend itself to the individual whom she was addressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The demon listened with attention to Martha&rsquo;s speech, and at its
      conclusion warmly complimented her upon the fertility of her brain, and
      expressed his candid opinion that she deserved to have been a demon
      herself. He owned that he felt bound, as a gentleman and a devil, to give
      her every assistance in his power, and asked her several questions as to
      the manner in which she thought he could be of most use in furthering her
      views. The waiting-maid replied that her only fear was as to her being
      able to persuade the people to take her advice and rise against the Baron.
      The old feudal principle still lurked in their breasts, and although they
      were certainly poor they were tolerably honest, and having been generally
      treated with kindness by the inhabitants of the castle, might possibly be
      weak enough to entertain towards them sentiments of affection and
      gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The demon, however, who knew better than Martha how little of either of
      these feelings exists in the heart of man, smiled a contemptuous smile at
      her ignorance of human nature, and told her that she need feel no
      uneasiness <span class="pagenum"><a name="link077" id="link077"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p077.jpg">077</a></span>upon the point.
      He added, however, that as she doubted her persuasive powers, he would
      give her such valuable aid as would materially improve her chances of
      success. He would forthwith speak to two highly respectable wehr-wolves of
      his acquaintance, who would be ready, for his sake, to accompany her
      whenever she went out among the peasants. By following her closely, these
      animals would add to the estimation in which the ignorant rustics would
      hold her, and although they would not speak when she was in the company of
      other mortals, they would give her many private hints which she would find
      immeasurably useful in persuading those with whom she would have to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much gratified by this assurance, Martha wended her way homewards in
      better spirits than she had enjoyed for some time past, and was even able
      to smile contemptuously when she found that the young Baron had taken the
      opportunity of her absence to put a hedgehog in her bed, and empty a
      bottle of castor oil into her best Sunday boots. She lost no time in
      commencing operations, and almost every afternoon walked out into the
      country to spread disaffection among the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, it is true, she was rather frightened at the appearance of the
      wehr-wolves, whom the demon had been as good as his word in sending to
      meet her. They always waited for her at the corner of a neighbouring wood,
      and accompanied her to the cottages of the peasants. After a short time
      she began to hold small meetings of the latter, at which she held forth
      concerning the wrongs they suffered at the hands of the Baron: how
      shameful it was that <i>he</i> should be so rich and <i>they</i> so poor,
      and how one man was just as good as another.
    </p>
    <p>
      She <span class="pagenum"><a name="link078" id="link078"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p078.jpg">078</a></span>always took care
      to wind up by attributing much of their particular miseries to the bad
      influence of the Baroness, whom she denounced as an upholder of everything
      bad, a cruel tyrant in her household, and altogether a monster of
      iniquity. As she lectured in this way, one of the wehr-wolves generally
      sat just behind her and the other at the other end of the room, and the
      presence of these animals made a vast impression upon the ignorant
      peasants. In this manner, little by little, the wicked Martha obtained
      considerable influence over the poor people, who became gradually more and
      more moody and discontented, until at last they really came to look upon
      the Baron as a hateful tyrant, and regarded the Baroness as a monster in
      human form.

      While all these things were going on, you must not suppose, Brother
      Thames, that evil was allowed to enjoy an uninterrupted triumph in
      Rhineland. I am glad to be able to say that such has never been the case
      for long; and that although my stream has always been more or less
      troubled by demons, imps, devilets, and water-rats <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link079" id="link079"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p079.jpg">079</a></span>(which are
      nearly as bad), it has never been without a redeeming element in the shape
      of good fairies, nymphs, and an occasional stray mermaid, come up from the
      sea for change of air and scenery. These creatures have, from time to
      time, performed many acts of kindness to mankind, and when the powers of
      evil have proved too strong for them for a time, they have now and then
      requested me to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present instance a strong deputation of nymphs waited upon me, and
      brought before me a particular part of the case which I am now about to
      enter upon. Among those persons who were most greatly plagued by the false
      heir, were his three supposed sisters, the elder children of the Baron and
      Baroness von Bandelboots. These young ladies were endowed with
      considerable personal attractions, and were girls of whom a brother might
      well have been proud. Dora, Bertha, and Elladine were the names of the
      three, and up to the time of the changing of the children they had lived
      lives as happy and contented as was compatible with the ever-varying
      temper of their worthy mother. They were quite young, indeed, when the
      event occurred which so destroyed the comfort of the Bandelboots
      household, and at the time at which I have now arrived in my narration
      were just budding into womanhood, three as fair flowers as you would wish
      to see. Their young devilet of a brother, or rather he who was supposed to
      be their brother, contrived to make their existence perfectly miserable;
      and as the Baroness invariably took his part against them, their lives at
      last became positively unendurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not only that a chignon was constantly hidden or <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link080" id="link080"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p080.jpg">080</a></span>stolen just when
      it was wanted, stays were mysteriously cut, gloves spoiled, best bonnets
      crammed up the chimney, and best boots deposited in the bath. These
      discomforts were unpleasant enough, but the little wretch went far beyond
      them. He pinched and nipped the poor girls whenever he met them, trod on
      their toes suddenly, drew away their chairs just as they were about to sit
      down, and put rhubarb and magnesia into their five o&rsquo;clock tea.
      Moreover, he carried all kinds of tales about them to the Baroness, and
      told falsehood upon falsehood for the mere purpose of getting them into
      disgrace. Then, when the Baroness inflicted punishment upon them, he would
      jeer and taunt and tease the poor girls, rendering it doubly disagreeable
      by his ill-natured and malicious joy. Nothing delighted him so much as to
      see others suffer, and it seemed as if he lived for nothing else save to
      procure as much misery as possible for his neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      This state of things gradually drove Dora, Bertha, and Elladine to
      desperation; and, after many plans and consultations, they determined to
      seek advice from some of the good spirits of my river. As it happened,
      however, that, although they are very willing to give good advice and to
      assist mortals whenever they can, my nymphs and fairies are restrained by
      etiquette from active interference with the demons in those parts of the
      river especially appropriated to the latter, the good creatures thought it
      better to bring the matter before me; and on being consulted by the young
      ladies, the nymph who saw them upon the subject told them to come again at
      a certain time, before which she waited upon me, as I have said, with a
      deputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <span class="pagenum"><a name="link081" id="link081"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p081.jpg">081</a></span>the case had
      been fairly represented to me, I saw at once that it was one in which
      something should be done, and I accordingly promised that if the three
      young persons would bathe together at a certain spot on the following
      morning, I would present myself before them and hear their story.

    <p>
      The time came, and I can assure you, Brother Thames, that in order to
      inspire confidence in the breasts of the maidens, I made my appearance as
      venerable as I could previous to my appearance before their astonished
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link082" id="link082"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p082.jpg">082</a></span>sweet creatures
      stood in the water clinging fondly to each other, as they implored my
      assistance; and whilst I listened to their artless tale of woe, I leaned
      my head upon my hand, and pondered deeply over the best course to be taken
      in order to afford them that assistance which I at once determined to
      render.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not long in making up my mind, and in resolving that the demons
      should not be allowed to have things all their own way. However, as you
      know very well, the laws of magic must not be broken, and it would never
      have done for me to have rudely and suddenly exercised my superior power
      in order to set matters right in the castle of Bandelboots. All I could
      fairly do was to put mortals in the way of helping themselves, at the same
      time interfering, if need should arise, with just as much exercise of
      power as might be necessary. So, having spoken words of comfort to the
      three girls, I told them to go home and try and bear their misfortunes for
      three days more, and at the end of that time, if matters were no better,
      they might again pay me a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, as you may suppose, no improvement in their condition during
      the appointed time. In fact, their supposed brother was, if possible,
      rather worse than ever. He cut off a great bit of Bertha&rsquo;s back
      hair, stole up behind Elladine and boxed her ears violently, and finished
      up by giving Dora&rsquo;s pet canary to the cat, which he afterwards hung,
      as he said, for the murder. It was no matter of surprise to me, then, when
      the three maidens again presented themselves before me, weeping bitterly
      over their many misfortunes and sorrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I no longer hesitated as to the course which I should pursue, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link083" id="link083"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p083.jpg">083</a></span>but immediately
      changed the sisters into three magnificent swans, desiring them to
      frequent as much as possible the lake on which their father&rsquo;s castle
      stood. This course, as you will readily perceive, had a double effect of a
      most useful character. For one thing, it of course showed the inhabitants
      of the castle that something was wrong, and aroused both the Baron and
      Baroness to exertions for the recovery of their lost daughters which would
      very likely result in their finding out from the powers of magic
      something, as the lawyers say, &ldquo;very much to their advantage.&rdquo;
      But above and beyond this was the circumstance that, as swans are gifted
      with the miraculous power of seeing through magical disguises, the young
      ladies would be perfectly certain to encounter and recognise their real
      brother in some of his flittings over the lake, and thus would eventually
      be brought about the consummation so devoutly to be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may well believe that the disappearance of the three girls plunged the
      castle into the direst confusion. No one could imagine where they had gone
      to, and all kinds of surmises were afloat. The Baron smoked twice as many
      pipes as usual; the Baroness flew into a more violent passion than had
      been the case for a month before; poor old nurse Grutchen wept bitterly;
      Martha Scweinvolt seemed to have more vinegar than ever in her
      countenance; and the false heir ran about teasing and worrying everybody
      twice as much as usual, and was apparently in the highest possible spirits
      at the loss of his sisters. Every hole and corner of the castle was
      searched, the river was dragged, the crier was sent through the straggling
      hamlets of the neighbourhood, special <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link084" id="link084"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p084.jpg">084</a></span>messengers were
      despatched in every direction, but it is needless to say that no success
      attended any of these proceedings.

    <p>
      And the stately swans swam all the time around the ancient walls of their
      ancestral home, and floated upon the waters of the lake they knew so well,
      thankful for the peace and rest which they at last enjoyed, and caressing
      each other with the tender love of creatures who knew that upon their
      mutual love and sympathy depended the whole comfort and happiness of their
      lives. Nor indeed were they long left in ignorance of the truth as to
      their unhappy brother. Scarcely had they been two days upon the old lake,
      before the transformed child came flying up from the river to take his
      mournful look at the home from which he had been so cruelly ravished. As
      he flew low over the waters he passed close to the three lovely swans, and
      they, casting their eyes upon him as they sat mournfully watching,
      recognised their brother at once through the hideous disguise <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link085" id="link085"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p085.jpg">085</a></span>he wore, and
      called him to them with loud cries of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bat-boy paused in his flight, hovered for a moment near to the noble
      birds, and then, as he heard them speak, the whole of his sad story came
      back to him, the memories of his first few months upon earth as a mortal
      child were stirred in his bosom, and he knew clearly and fully his true
      nature and origin, and the cruel wrongs he had endured at the hands of the
      treacherous waiting-maid and her wicked ally the river-demon. As soon as
      he had fully realised the truth, the boy tenderly embraced his
      swan-sisters, and the four wept together over the sorrows of their family.
      Being well aware, however, that weeping would be of very little service
      unless followed by active measures, they discontinued that amusing pastime
      after a while, and consulted together as to the best course to be pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although comparatively happy in their new shape, the sisters readily
      confessed that they should infinitely prefer to resume their human bodies,
      provided that they could be assured of being able to live quietly and
      comfortably, and of being no longer troubled with the malice of the
      devilet heir. The youthful Hubert had of course no affection whatever for
      the form to which he had been condemned, and therefore the object of the
      four was clear enough, namely, to return to their natural shapes as soon
      as possible under more favourable conditions than those in which they had
      left them. The question was as to the wisest and best means of securing
      this desirable object, and here the magic knowledge generally possessed by
      swans came to their assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They <span class="pagenum"><a name="link086" id="link086"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p086.jpg">086</a></span>knew full well
      that their brother could never become his former self until the devilet
      who now possessed his shape and claimed rights which were his should be
      compelled to abandon both. They knew, moreover, that to bring this about
      would be a work requiring caution, since the river-demon was powerful and
      cunning enough to counteract all their efforts unless they could contrive
      to outwit him. It was, however, revealed to the sisters that there was one
      way in which this might be done, and by which the retransformation of
      their brother might be effected, and the false heir be obliged to return
      to him that sent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There lived far up in the great mountains, which could be seen in the
      distance from the castle windows, a being endowed with wondrous powers. He
      was commonly known by the name of the Harper, and a strange fellow he
      certainly was. No one quite knew whether he was merely mortal or something
      more. All that was certain was, that he lived the life of a hermit, was by
      no means particular in his dress or remarkably clean in his appearance,
      and wore a flat hat with ivy and oak leaves woven together on the crown.
      His harp was of the rudest and simplest character, but it had such
      extraordinary virtue that if he played it, accompanying himself while he
      sang or chanted to its tune, everybody and everything seemed obliged to
      yield to its magic powers. The sisters of Bandelboots knew full well that
      if this individual&rsquo;s aid could be secured things would be pretty
      sure to go right, and therefore made up their minds to seek it without
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night nothing could be done; the swans brooded quietly on the lake,
      and their brother flitted mournfully round <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link087" id="link087"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p087.jpg">087</a></span>the castle,
      uttering his melancholy cries, and hovering close to the windows of the
      home that should have been his. But early next morning the three swans
      rose from the water and took their flight towards the great mountains.
      Upwards and upwards they flew, pausing not for one moment&rsquo;s rest,
      until they had crossed the river, passed over the large forest beyond, and
      reached the steep rocks and crags amid which the Harper had his home.
      There was snow on the heights, and the poor birds felt the chill strike
      through their warm plumage to their tender breasts as they flew higher and
      higher. Suddenly they came to a small grove of trees which grew on a
      platform of flat land, which was curiously placed just beneath one of the
      highest crags. At the extremity of this was a cave hollowed out in the
      rock, and in this cave dwelt the worthy Harper, only coming forth to the
      world below when specially summoned for some purpose beneficial to weak
      and suffering humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alighting at the mouth of the cave, the three sisters began to sing their
      sweetest song, which not unnaturally brought the owner of the cave out to
      see what was the matter. This his knowledge of magic soon enabled him to
      ascertain, and it is hardly necessary that I should give you the details
      of the interview. Suffice it to say that when they parted the worthy old
      gentleman nodded his head and winked his eyes knowingly at the young
      ladies, as much as to assure them that it would be &ldquo;all right,&rdquo;
      and that the three swans flew back to the lake exceedingly well satisfied
      with the result of their expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Martha Scweinvolt had very nearly brought <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link088" id="link088"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p088.jpg">088</a></span>her plans to
      maturity. The peasantry had become thoroughly discontented, and were
      prepared to take action against the family whom they had been taught to
      regard as their oppressors. Martha&rsquo;s desire was that they should
      surprise the castle by a sudden assault, she on her part undertaking that
      one of the gates should be unfastened when they arrived, and only
      stipulating that, if success attended their attempt, the Baroness should
      be delivered up to her mercy. The chief difficulty was in the means of
      transit, for the castle, being upon an island, could not easily be
      attacked except the latter were first reached by its assailants.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one side the island was very near the mainland, from which a strip of
      land jutted out into the lake, and a large wooden bridge connected the
      two. This was the ordinary means of approach; and as a strong gate was
      placed at the island end of the bridge, over which a sentinel always
      watched, it was not very easy for any considerable body of men to cross
      over without their coming being made known to the inhabitants of the
      castle. Martha, however, was equal to the occasion. She managed to make
      friends with the sentinel on the night for which the attack was planned,
      and having induced him to abandon his post for a time, gave him a cup of
      tea so well drugged that he was quite unable to return there. The effect
      upon this man, I may here mention, was a melancholy one. From thenceforth
      he eschewed tea for ever, and took to drinking ale and spirits for the
      rest of his life, which should be a warning to all persons to take care
      what they put into their tea, and by whom they allow themselves to be
      tempted to partake of that usually refreshing beverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having <span class="pagenum"><a name="link089" id="link089"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p089.jpg">089</a></span>thus obtained
      possession of the key, Martha stole out and unlocked the bridge-gate, and
      returned to the castle delighted with her success. Once on the little
      island, the invaders of the castle would have little difficulty. The
      drawbridge was left down, the doors generally left open, and such was the
      security of the Baron in those peaceful days, that no precautions, further
      than guarding the bridge-gate, were ever taken against surprise. Besides
      the servants, there were not above five-and-twenty men-at-arms in the
      castle; and as several hundred peasants were likely to attack, there could
      be little doubt of the result, provided always that the surprise was as
      complete as Martha intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was clear and moonlight when the attacking party drew near. They
      were a strange-looking body of men, rudely and poorly clad, and armed with
      weapons of a varied and curious character. Some had clubs, some stakes
      sharpened at the points, some knives, daggers, and oddly fashioned swords,
      whilst not a few had only spades or prongs, and some appeared unprovided
      with any weapons save those which nature had given them. They crossed the
      bridge without opposition, found to their delight that the gate was open,
      passed quietly through it, and got safely upon the island. They advanced
      to the drawbridge, crossed it, and had nothing to do but to enter the
      doors beyond, and find themselves inside the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family had passed a somewhat unpleasant day. The Baron had taken
      deeply to heart the loss of his daughters, of whom he had become more than
      usually fond since his supposed son had shown himself of such a
      disagreeable character. The latter had been that day more <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link090" id="link090"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p090.jpg">090</a></span>mischievous and
      troublesome than ever: as the Baroness had a headache, he had amused
      himself with making as much noise as he possibly could, and had, moreover,
      indulged his passion for practical jokes by putting live toads into the
      maid-servants&rsquo; beds, and turning the ink-bottle into the Baron&rsquo;s
      after-dinner decanter of port wine. The household not having been rendered
      more comfortable or harmonious by these innocent pastimes of the pretended
      Hubert, were about to retire to rest, when the sudden arrival of the
      insurgent peasants gave them something else to think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were well inside the doors, the attacking party kept
      silence no longer, but, with loud shouts, began their work of plunder. The
      defenders of the castle were really so completely surprised, that
      resistance was almost impossible. The trembling servants hid themselves
      wherever they could&mdash;the groom of the chamber shutting himself up
      securely in the housemaid&rsquo;s closet, the housekeeper flying instantly
      to the butler&rsquo;s pantry, and the latter functionary betaking himself
      immediately to the beer-cellar, from which he was with difficulty dragged
      when the affair was over, but was never the same man afterwards. The
      men-at-arms, I am sorry to say, did but little better. Utterly bewildered
      at the whole business, they made no attempt at resistance until it was too
      late, and within a very short time the castle was in the hands of the
      invaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Baron heard the first outcry he rang the bell loudly, and,
      as nobody answered, presently repeated the performance, with a precisely
      similar result. He had been just about to retire to rest, but finding that
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link091" id="link091"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p091.jpg">091</a></span>uproar
      increased, and that something serious had certainly happened, he desisted
      from the act of pulling off his boots, seized his sword, and rushed down
      into the large state-room, where he was presently joined by some eight or
      ten of the men-at-arms and two or three of the household servants. As soon
      as he found that the castle had been attacked, and was actually in
      possession of an enemy, the Baron gnashed his teeth with rage at having
      been thus caught unprepared; but, being a man of courage, despite his
      natural laziness, determined to sell his life dearly at the least. He and
      his few retainers had just time to barricade the door at one end of the
      room, and place the large library-table and some other articles of
      furniture in such a position as to give them a better chance of
      self-defence if attacked by numbers, when the doors at the other end of
      the room were thrown violently open, and a crowd of peasants rushed in,
      yelling and bawling in loud and discordant tones as they advanced towards
      the master of the castle. It was at this moment that the old blood of the
      Bandelboots showed itself to advantage. The Baron displayed no signs of
      fear, but, drawing himself up to his full height (which, being barely four
      feet six inches, was of itself not imposing), and violently stamping his
      foot upon the floor, he thus addressed the intruders:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now, varlets! Whence and for what object come ye here? How do
      ye dare, ye scum of the earth, to enter your Baron&rsquo;s castle and
      beard a Bandelboots in his lair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then stepped there forth a tattered, ragged, famished-looking man, well
      known in those parts by the name of Crazy Timothy; his eyes were wild and
      staring, his dress <span class="pagenum"><a name="link092" id="link092"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p092.jpg">092</a></span>torn, and his
      whole appearance seemed amply to justify his nickname.

    <p>
      &ldquo;We want our rights!&rdquo; he cried in a loud voice. &ldquo;What is
      a Bandelboots to us more than anybody else? We are starving, whilst you
      and your vile Baroness revel in plenty. Give us our rights&mdash;these are
      the days when the poor are as good as the rich! No more starvation for the
      poor peasant! Give us our rights!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon the whole crew took up the chorus. &ldquo;Our rights! our
      rights!&mdash;give us our rights!&rdquo; and made as though they would
      advance upon the old Baron. The latter quailed not for a moment, but,
      curling his lips scornfully, thus made reply:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rights? But what are they? Is it your rights to enter a peaceful
      dwelling and rob its owner? If these are your rights, why are they <i>yours</i>
      more than the rights of all the rest of the world? What better title have
      you to your homes than I to mine? And if you may enter and rob my castle,
      what protection has any one of you for his own cottage, which some one may
      say it is <i>his</i> right to enter and destroy? Poor churls! ye are
      deceived, and will but bring ruin upon yourselves. Retire before it is too
      late, and ye shall yet be pardoned!&rdquo; Whatever might have been the
      Baron&rsquo;s intention in uttering <span class="pagenum"><a name="link093"
      id="link093"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p093.jpg">093</a></span>these
      words, I am sorry to say that they had no conciliatory effect upon those
      to whom they were addressed. Shouting aloud and brandishing their weapons,
      they were about to advance upon the venerable nobleman, when, from a side
      door, some new personages suddenly appeared upon the scene. Pushed along
      in a chair upon wheels, to which she was securely bound, came the
      Baroness, in the custody of several peasants, who were under the more
      immediate guidance and control of Martha Scweinvolt. The latter, with a
      face beaming with delight, followed triumphantly behind, whilst the false
      heir, weeping and howling piteously, trotted by the side of the chair,
      driven forward by the peasants who ushered the Baroness into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor Baroness presented a spectacle sad indeed to behold. She was in a
      towering rage, but at the same time perfectly helpless, and foamed at the
      mouth with fury as she strove in vain to get loose from the cords with
      which she was tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      When these new arrivals had advanced into the room between the Baron and
      the peasants, there was a momentary pause, during which Martha stepped in
      front of the chair upon which the poor Baroness was fastened, and,
      pointing at her with outstretched arm and scornful gesture, addressed the
      peasants in these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here she is, good people; here is the source of all your ills&mdash;the
      cause of all your woes! The poor fool of a Baron would do no harm but for
      this vile woman. See what a passion she is in now! This is her usual
      temper; and no wonder she is such a tyrant, and makes her husband the
      same!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At <span class="pagenum"><a name="link094" id="link094"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p094.jpg">094</a></span>this point the
      Baroness broke in, having previously-vented her rage in sobs and
      incoherent shrieks. &ldquo;Let me loose! let me loose!&rdquo; she cried.
      &ldquo;You riff-raff&mdash;you vagabonds&mdash;you traitors&mdash;let me
      loose directly! This wretched creature has deceived you all; she is a
      worthless, good-for-nothing hussy. Let me loose, or I vow you shall all be
      hanged!&rdquo; And the Baroness shrieked for fury again, her temper being
      by no means improved by the false heir, who, despite all his fears for
      himself, seeing her securely tied, could not resist the temptation of
      giving her a fearful pinch in the fleshy part of the arm, for which a
      peasant instantly knocked him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Martha could speak again, the Baron, who was a good old chap in the
      main, roared out aloud: &ldquo;By my grandfather&rsquo;s monument!&rdquo;
      cried he (an oath all the more terrible from the edifice in question being
      well known to be the largest and ugliest of its kind for miles around);
      &ldquo;this is past all bearing! Knaves! will ye list to the falsehoods of
      this base harridan, who has eaten our salt for years, and now wags her
      evil tongue against a kind, though perhaps somewhat hasty, mistress? Never
      has the Baroness said a word against one of ye. <i>My</i> faults, whatever
      they be, are mine own, and for them <i>I</i> will answer. But what has the
      Baroness done? Who sends ye alms and food when sickness is amongst ye? Who
      helps your wives and children when trouble is in your homes? Who but the
      Baroness? And is <i>this</i> your gratitude?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some truth in what the Baron now said, for his wife was by no
      means unkind to the poor, nor would they have readily turned against her
      but for the wiles <span class="pagenum"><a name="link095" id="link095"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p095.jpg">095</a></span>of Martha,
      assisted by the magical powers of the wehr-wolves. But Martha knew too
      well to let the Baron continue. She broke in upon his discourse with her
      shrill, sharp voice: &ldquo;Hear the good man, my friends; he is right to
      stand up for his wife, no doubt, but he knows well that he is false to the
      truth. She is a wretch, a tyrant, a termagant! Yes, Madam the Baroness,&rdquo;
      she continued, coming close in front of the chair, and approaching her
      face much nearer to that of the poor lady than the latter deemed at all
      pleasant&mdash;&ldquo;yes, your reign is at an end&mdash;do you hear, you
      old fright? Your back hair shall be pulled out; though, as it is nearly
      all false, it will cause you but little pain. Your nose shall be wrung!&mdash;your
      ears shall be slit!&mdash;and you shall serve <i>me</i>&mdash;do you hear?
      Oh, <i>you&rsquo;re</i> a pretty one to box a person&rsquo;s ears. I&rsquo;ll
      pay you out <i>now</i> for <i>that</i>, I&rsquo;ll warrant me!&rdquo; And
      as she spoke she lifted up her arm, about to give the Baroness a box on
      the ears with her full force. But in the very act she paused&mdash;stopped&mdash;and
      stood trembling and irresolute, as if suddenly arrested by some superior
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, and apparently by the same influence, the peasants one
      and all felt themselves restrained from moving forwards, the Baroness
      ceased to scream, and a dead silence fell upon the whole of the party,
      whilst, with a low and miserable moan, the false heir crept behind the
      coal-scuttle, and crouched himself down within as small a compass as
      possible. The whole of this marvellous effect had apparently been produced
      by a very trifling cause. The low, tinkling sound of a harp was heard, and
      those who looked round in the right direction saw, standing in the
      embrasure of one <span class="pagenum"><a name="link096" id="link096"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p096.jpg">096</a></span>of the windows
      which looked out upon the lake, an old man of by no means noble or
      prepossessing exterior, with a leaf-crowned hat upon his head, and a harp
      of very simple construction in his hands, from the strings of which he
      elicited the sound they had heard, to which he now added that of his own
      voice. And thus he sang, in a dull, monotonous tone, to the astonished
      audience:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Whoever murders, robs, and loots,
Within these walls of Bandelboots,
Must hear his doom and take his choice,
Instructed by the Harper&rsquo;s voice.

Ye men of form and manners rough,
Old Bandelboots has woes enough,
The which when ye have heard and known
You&rsquo;ll leave the worthy man alone.

To you and yours he&rsquo;s done no harm,
But, subject to a potent charm,
Has suffered woes, by demon sent,
Enough to make your hearts relent.

T&rsquo; expose the wickedness be mine
(In spite of demons of the Rhine),
And ye who list shall know ere long
The truth and justice of my song.

There was an infant once, who smiled
On those around like angel child;
A child of soul and temper rare&mdash;
Of Bandelboots the precious heir.

Where now that child is to be found,
Who knows? I pause, and look around,
And ask if this description suits
The present heir of Bandelboots?

What is that wretched changeling worth?
Come forth, vile elf, at once come forth!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here the stranger paused, and, to the wonder and surprise of all those who
      heard and saw, the supposed young heir crept moaning and whining from
      behind the coal-scuttle, and shambled across the room towards the window
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link097" id="link097"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p097.jpg">097</a></span>at which the old
      harper was standing. As he did so, the strange bard continued his song,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Form of boy, with heart of ape,
Resume at once thy former shape!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As he spoke, a strange transformation came at once over the wretched imp.
      His boyish shape disappeared; a tail shot out where tails usually grow;
      the wings of a bat sprang upon his shoulders; his form became ugly and
      misshapen, and he stood before them all a regular devilet, and no mistake!
      At the very same instant the window behind the harper flew open as if by
      magic, and in flew a figure similar to that before them, from which,
      however, the wings and tail dropped, the evil shape disappeared, and a
      handsome, well-proportioned boy, with a remarkably sweet expression upon
      his countenance, stood before the astonished party.

    <p>
      In an instant a shriek of joy was heard from the corner in which some of
      the trembling servants were assembled, and old nurse Grutchen rushed
      forward and threw herself upon the boy&rsquo;s neck with a burst of
      mingled sobs and laughter. &ldquo;My pet! my darling! my child!&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> you! I know it is you! Come to old Sophie then,
      my pearl of the world;&rdquo; and again she shrieked with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      More <span class="pagenum"><a name="link098" id="link098"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p098.jpg">098</a></span>wonders followed
      before any of the audience had recovered from their astonishment at what
      had already occurred. With a yell and a howl the devilet flew towards the
      window, his passage through which was mightily assisted by a hearty kick
      from the old harper, and he was seen no more. Scarcely, however, had he
      left the scene when the rushing of wings was heard, and three magnificent
      swans sailed through the window and alighted in the room, exactly in front
      of the old harper, to whom they looked up with longing and affectionate
      glances. The worthy man at once struck his harp again, and sang as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Old Bandelboots, as well ye wot,
Had once three lovely daughters,
For whom the place became too hot,
Through imps from river waters.

Then the Rhine King (a wondrous thing,
Which needs some explanation)
His aid did to the maidens bring,
Gave each Swan&rsquo;s plumage, neck, and wing,
And caused their transformation.

Now here the three together be
(Performed their destined duties),
And I decree they shall be free
Once more. Arise, my beauties!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As he ceased speaking the feathers fell off from the three swans, their
      beaks changed into beautiful noses, their forms became those of lovely
      young ladies, and Dora, Bertha, and Elladine once more stood in their
      proper shapes before their surprised and delighted parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this had been going on, the youthful Hubert, making one bound
      forward, sprang to his mother&rsquo;s chair, and, seizing a dagger from
      the hand of a bewildered <span class="pagenum"><a name="link099"
      id="link099"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p099.jpg">099</a></span>peasant,
      set her free in an instant. Upon this the Baroness, overcome by mingled
      emotions of joy and wonder, wept upon her boy&rsquo;s neck, and the old
      harper thus continued, addressing himself emphatically to the crowd of
      peasants before him:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Poor knaves! who quake and shake with fear,
O&rsquo;erwhelmed with terror and with shame,
The powers of evil lured ye here:
Theirs and not yours, the chiefest blame.

Hence! fly! be off! your injured lord
For this day&rsquo;s work will pardon give:
For him I speak this kindly word:,
To-day he knows his children live.

Begone, I say! and, as to wrongs,
Yours are but small; the fiends beshrew ye.
If e&rsquo;er ye listen to false tongues
Which lie about your masters to ye!

Be each contented with his lot&mdash;
Both rich and poor this world containeth;
But let this truth be ne&rsquo;er forgot&mdash;
O&rsquo;er rich and poor &lsquo;tis God that reigneth;

Nor is full happiness e&rsquo;er given
To mortal man this side of heaven.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He spoke, and, as he concluded, the peasants, half frightened and half
      ashamed, began to steal away by twos and threes at a time, until none of
      them were left behind. The Baron, who had listened with the utmost
      attention to the words of the old harper, now stepped forward and tenderly
      embraced his daughters, after which he clasped his recovered boy to his
      heart, and vowed that upon that joyous day no one should be punished, and
      even the treacherous peasants who had invaded his castle should be freely
      forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness fell weeping on her husband&rsquo;s heart, loudly bewailed
      her own infirmity of temper, and vowed that she would never fly into a
      passion again. At this the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link100"
      id="link100"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p100.jpg">100</a></span>Baron,
      whilst her face was hidden upon his shoulder, slowly elevated his right
      hand, placed his forefinger horizontally against the side of his nose, and
      winked knowingly at his daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the Baroness raised her head, and, in tones of some feeling,
      asked what had become of that wretched Martha, gnashing her teeth as she
      spoke with an air that inspired considerable doubts as to her being&rsquo;
      able to keep her new resolution. This, however, was not put to the test as
      far as Martha was concerned. As soon as she perceived that things were
      going wrong, but that the harper was not alluding to <i>her</i> in his
      verse, that worthy person slipped quietly from the room and the castle,
      and sought refuge in the wood where her wehr-wolves usually met her. The
      animals were there as at other times, but their reception of her was not
      the same. No sooner was she within the wood than the expression of their
      countenances grew strange and fierce, so that the woman trembled all over.
      In another instant they seized upon her and dragged her, one on each side,
      near to where the wood touched the banks of the river. Wildly she shrieked
      for aid, and in another moment the form of the River-demon appeared upon
      the bank. This time, however, he had no cheering counsel to give. With a
      wild and derisive laugh he pointed jeeringly at the unhappy woman, whom
      the wehr-wolves held fast, while they growled-fearfully and savagely all
      the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, Martha!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;hast thou come to the end of
      thy revenge at last? They who seek demon-help must have demon-punishment,
      and thine hour is come to-day. Know this, poor wretch! that those who
      yield to their passions cherish within them that which will one <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link101" id="link101"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p101.jpg">101</a></span>day tear and
      destroy them as the wehr-wolves are about to do to thee, and those who
      wish for a happy end must control and govern themselves on the journey!&rdquo;
      Then, with a fiendish leer and grin, he nodded his head to the
      wehr-wolves, and in another moment the wretched Martha was tom limb from
      limb, and perished miserably. Folks say that her spirit still haunts that
      wood, and that on dark and stormy nights her shrieks may be heard,
      accompanied by the growling of the wehr-wolves and the laugh of the
      exulting demon. But you and I, Brother Thames, know well how foolish
      mortals are with their tales of horror, and how ready they are to mistake
      a creaking tree for a shriek and a moonbeam for a spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have nothing more to say except that when the Baron and Baroness turned
      round to bless the old harper for his kindly aid, they saw nothing where
      he had been standing save the light of the sweet, pale moon shining in
      through the window. The harper had gone without waiting to be thanked, and
      they saw him no more. From thenceforth no spirits troubled the Bandelboots
      family, save when the Baron took an extra glass of brandy, which
      occasionally flew to his toe. The Baroness decidedly improved in temper,
      profiting by the example of her son, who grew up to be one of the most
      sweet-tempered and agreeable young noblemen that ever lived upon the banks
      of my river. Of the three girls, I can only say that as they made
      excellent daughters and capital sisters, they succeeded equally well when
      they entered upon the cares and joys of matrimony, and no women, married
      or single, were more often toasted in good Steinburgh than the three
      famous beauties, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link102" id="link102"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p102.jpg">102</a></span>the swan-like
      daughters of the Baron von Bandelboots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Rhine here ceased, and as soon as he had done so Father Thames
      struck a tremendous blow upon the table and vowed that the story he had
      just heard was one of the best that had ever been told. &ldquo;I wish,
      however,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you could have told us a little more
      upon one or two points, Brother Rhine. It would be satisfactory to know
      that the rascally little scamp of a devilet was well punished when he got
      home; but I suppose you know not whether such was the case or what became
      of him afterwards?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Brother Thames, gravely replied the monarch of the
      Rhine, &ldquo;I know not; and in fact I have always kept as much as
      possible aloof from the demons of my river, only showing them that
      ordinary civility which is rendered necessary by my position. I have
      little doubt, however, that the imp had misery enough in his future
      existence. No one who habitually annoys and injures others can ever have
      any real happiness himself, and, whether imp or mortal, unkindness and
      malice always recoil upon those who practise the one and are influenced by
      the other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; remarked Father Thames, &ldquo;your words are
      true. But what became of the Baroness? Did she outlive the Baron, and was
      he cured of his laziness as well as she of her bad temper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said his companion in an expostulating tone,
      &ldquo;you really ask more than I can recollect. There are very many
      castles in the vicinity of my river, and to remember the details of the
      family history of all their inhabitants <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link103" id="link103"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p103.jpg">103</a></span>is more than
      even I, as a river monarch, can venture to &lsquo;undertake. I may,
      however, safely say that the Baroness died before the Baron, for I happen
      to be able to recall the circumstances of her death. She was inordinately
      fond of dried cherries, and would insist upon swallowing the stones. For
      some time this had no effect, but at last she was taken ill and died of a
      disease so mysterious that they determined to have her body opened, when
      no less than two hundred and forty-six cherry-stones were found inside
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; exclaimed Father Thames in great
      surprise. &ldquo;But now tell me what happened to the Baron.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must positively decline,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;A
      legend is a legend, and I have told you mine. It is now your turn, and I
      hope you will lose no time, for I expect the Rhone, the Danube, and the
      Seine upon a matter of business to-morrow, and shall be late for my
      appointment if we waste our time in unnecessary talking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, brother,&rdquo; shouted Father Thames, and, clearing his
      throat, began without further delay the story of&mdash;

      THE FAMILY FEUD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Baron Simon de
      Guerre-Ã -mort (whose name, considerably transformed by his Saxon
      neighbours, was familiarly rendered as &ldquo;Old Grammar&rdquo;) was an
      individual who, not to belie the said name, was of a somewhat warlike
      disposition. His ancestors had come over to these peaceful shores with
      &ldquo;Billy the Norman, that very great war-man,&rdquo; as the old song
      calls him, and very <span class="pagenum"><a name="link104" id="link104"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p104.jpg">104</a></span>great war-men
      had <i>they</i> been also from the time of their first arrival. They
      warred against the Saxons as long as the latter showed fight; then they
      warred with their brother barons; then they went to the crusades;
      afterwards they joined Simon de Montfort in his gallant struggle for
      English liberties; they had a turn at the Welsh at one time, and took
      their share in the Scotch wars at another; in short, wherever and whenever
      opportunity for fighting offered itself, the Guerre-Ã -mort family or its
      representative eagerly seized it and rushed into the thickest of the
      battle as cheerfully as a duck into water. Nor was the Baron Simon one
      whit behind his ancestors in this respect. On the contrary, he was as
      ready for war as any of them, and fully maintained the character and
      traditions of his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of which I write it was very much the fashion for great
      families to indulge in the luxury of hereditary foes, and a feud of long
      standing between this and that ancient house was such a customary thing
      that a nobleman who lived peaceably with all his neighbours was regarded
      as a slow kind of fellow, whose acquaintance was hardly worth having.
      There were generally wars of greater or less magnitude going on either
      within England herself or with some foreign enemy, which, one would have
      imagined, might have furnished sufficient employment to the fighting
      nobility of the day. This, however, was by no means the case; and though
      private feuds were sometimes left in abeyance for a time, when something
      more attractive in the way of battle and bloodshed happened to offer, yet
      they were never allowed to slumber too <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p105.jpg">105</a></span>long, and were
      invariably revived as soon as more peaceful times permitted their
      proprietors to indulge their private feelings and natural love of
      quarrelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hereditary enemy of Simon de Guerre-Ã -mort was the house of St. Aunay,
      which, like his own, had been first known in England after the Battle of
      Hastings had flooded the country with Norman nobility, and which was at
      the moment of which we speak represented by Count Horace as the head of
      its race. It is difficult to say why or wherefore these two families
      should have been at variance, since there was no apparent reason for such
      a state of things. Their castles were upon opposite sides of my dear old
      river, at no great distance, though neither of them within sight of it.
      Their lands stretched down to my waters, which formed a reasonable and
      proper boundary, and there was consequently none of that intermingling of
      field with field or farm with farm which has in all ages proved a fertile
      source of unpleasantness between neighbouring landed proprietors.
      Moreover, the two noblemen had never brushed against each other or
      differed materially upon any public matters. In fact there was no
      probability of their doing so; for Baron Simon was at this time the wrong
      side of sixty by several years, whilst Count Horace had not lived half the
      years which constitute that respectable age. No: it was a good,
      respectable old family feud, and I verily believe that it was more from
      family feeling than for any other reason that it was still cherished by
      both houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, according to my firm belief, entirely in consequence of their
      private differences that, when the wars <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link106" id="link106"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p106.jpg">106</a></span>of the Roses
      broke out, the two Norman noblemen took different sides, the Count of St.
      Aunay standing forward boldly for the House of York, whilst the Lord of
      Guerre-Ã -mort was Lancastrian to the backbone. As the latter was a leader
      of great repute, and could muster around his standard no inconsiderable
      number of retainers, he might probably have rendered great service to the
      cause he had espoused if he had acted with those well-known men who led
      its armies and managed its councils. But the Baron greatly preferred going
      his own way and fighting for his own hand and as soon as the country was
      well into the war, and everybody was harassing and worrying everybody else
      as much as they could, he determined that by far the best thing he could
      do to aid Henry of Lancaster was to cross the river and demolish the
      Castle of St. Aunay. Accordingly, he collected his forces, summoned his
      vassals and friends from all quarters and prepared for the expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember, as well as if it were but yesterday, when the Baron&rsquo;s
      army was halted along my banks preparatory to their crossing the river
      early on the following morning. The old chieftain himself, mounted on his
      powerful black charger, from whose eyes and nostrils the fire of war
      seemed to stream forth as he impatiently pawed the ground, rode out upon a
      hill above his troops, and gazed upon the scene before him. The moon was
      rising behind the distant hills, the evening was calm and still; but the
      heavens were cloudy, and strange lights from time to time darted across
      the sky, as if presaging the days of war and bloodshed which were about to
      come upon unhappy England. The old Baron was <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link107" id="link107"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p107.jpg">107</a></span>completely
      armed, and his long, straggling beard fell down upon his horse&rsquo;s
      mane before him as he sat erect in his saddle. I saw him elevate his
      mighty sword and shield, raising each arm on high as he looked with
      flashing eye and threatening gesture upon the country upon the other side
      of the river, and then and there he vowed a solemn vow that before he
      recrossed the Thames the Castle of St. Aunay should be sacked, his pride
      lowered, and his banner trailed in the dust. On high he shook his weapon
      as he took the oath, and full well I knew that the proud Norman would not
      fail to keep it, unless his foeman (who was probably taking an oath of a
      similar character about the same time) should have strength or cunning
      enough to prevent its accomplishment.

      But before I proceed any further with my story I am bound to introduce you
      to a person who, as you will soon perceive, is the main cause and reason
      why I have any story at all to tell. The Baron de Guerre-Ã -mort had an
      only daughter. As, from the beginning of time, it has been the constant
      habit of maidens similarly circumstanced to fall in love with the person
      most objectionable to their respected father, Mathilde de Guerre-Ã -mort
      formed no exception to this most natural and reasonable rule. As a matter
      of course, she was desperately attached to Horace de St. Aunay, who, for
      his part, having fallen head over ears in love with her at their first
      interview, remained in the same condition with unwearied resolution. How
      they first came to meet I cannot say. One would have supposed that there
      would have been difficulties, considering the hostility, existing between
      the two families; but the young lady&rsquo;s mother having <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link108" id="link108"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p108.jpg">108</a></span>been dead for
      many years, she enjoyed more liberty than was common to females of her
      rank and age in those days, and probably met the Count in some of her
      country rambles after birds&rsquo; nests, violets, or blackberries&mdash;three
      things which all young people who have lived much in the country find more
      or less attractive at certain seasons of the year. However this may be, it
      is certain that these two individuals met, took a mutual fancy to each
      other, and would, in all human probability, have been thought by their
      friends to have been exactly suited, had it not been for the highly
      respectable feud of which I have already spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron, who had not the remotest idea of the state of the case, grieved
      and afflicted his daughter beyond measure by the manner in which he abused
      her lover upon every possible occasion. Mathilde, poor girl, bore it all
      with exemplary fortitude, although she invariably endeavoured to turn the
      conversation into more pleasant channels. But when the matter went beyond
      words, and her father actually commenced to make preparations to invade
      his enemy&rsquo;s country and destroy his castle, the agony of the poor
      young lady can be more easily imagined than described. She came down each
      morning with eyes red from crying all through the night; she grew daily
      paler and paler; lost her appetite; could scarcely take her five o&rsquo;clock
      tea; sat with her hands before her, doing nothing; and burst out into
      hysterical fits of sobbing upon the slightest provocation. This sad
      condition of his daughter troubled the worthy baron not a little, and,
      naturally attributing it to any and every cause but the right one, he
      determined to try what change of air would do for her, and accordingly
      sent her to stay with <span class="pagenum"><a name="link109" id="link109"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p109.jpg">109</a></span>his sister, who
      was the superior of a convent in Reading. Here it was his hope that the
      society of the nuns would cheer the sweet damsel and restore her spirits,
      whilst the change of air and scenery might benefit her health. There were
      those, indeed, including her faithful old Saxon nurse Elfreda, who
      declared that the conversation of nuns was, as a rule, anything but
      enlivening, and Reading by no means particularly healthy or
      reinvigorating; but as nobody dared question the Baron&rsquo;s superior
      wisdom upon every subject, nothing was said against his plan, and Mathilde
      de Guerre-Ã -mort was safely transmitted to and domesticated in the convent
      just before the expedition against her lover&rsquo;s castle was undertaken
      by her respected parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace de St. Aunay, although he received warning of the coming attack,
      was by no means in a condition to offer such resistance as he could have
      wished. The Lancastrians were by far the stronger party in his
      neighbourhood, and the Baron&rsquo;s forces greatly outnumbered his own. I
      need not dwell upon the particulars of the events which followed. The
      Guerre-Ã -mort army crossed the river, defeated the levies of St. Aunay in
      a skirmish on the plain, and drove them in every direction before their
      victorious advance. Horace de St. Aunay, wounded by an arrow, was reported
      killed, and it was impossible to rally his people under another leader.
      The haughty Baron had it all his own way; he plundered the farmyards,
      raised a bonfire of what he didn&rsquo;t want to carry away, and made
      himself as unpleasant as possible to the harmless population, who,
      naturally and properly enough, no doubt, always have to suffer for the
      whims and quarrels of the great. He next <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link110" id="link110"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p110.jpg">110</a></span>marched upon the
      Castle of St. Aunay, but found that it was deserted, and, having by that
      time had enough of burning and plundering for a time, contented himself
      with throwing down the big gates, breaking a few windows, and flaunting
      his own banner over the highest turret. Then, having collected all his
      booty, he turned homewards, and, having satisfied his private grudge
      against his neighbour, felt his interest in the Lancastrian cause
      wonderfully lessened, and began to want his daughter back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, poor girl, had passed by no means a happy time in her convent, where
      the good nuns devoutly prayed for the Lancastrians, and especially for her
      worthy father, upon every possible opportunity, and where she never had a
      chance of hearing any news of her lover, or of saying a kind word for him
      or any other of his party. At last, one day, the lady superior informed
      her with an air of triumph that news had come of the defeat of St. Aunay&rsquo;s
      people by her father, and that the Count had been killed in the battle.
      The poor girl turned deadly pale, and swooned away at this intelligence.
      Fortunately for her, the Lady Superior, being a person of extraordinary
      intelligence, knew at once that such a result must certainly have been
      produced by Mathilde&rsquo;s alarm for her father&rsquo;s safety, and
      gratitude for his success. Having therefore taken the usual means to
      recover her from her fainting fit, the good lady loudly praised her filial
      affection, and held her up to the rest of the sisterhood as an example
      worthy of imitation, Mathilde thought it best to receive these compliments
      without taking any steps to alter the opinion of her worthy relative, but
      her suspense and anxiety were very <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link111" id="link111"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p111.jpg">111</a></span>great, and all
      the more so from the fact that the difficulty of obtaining news of an
      authentic character was so considerable, that in all probability it would
      be weeks, and perhaps months, before she learned for certain whether her
      beloved Horace was alive or dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days rolled on&mdash;days of miserable uncertainty, which was scarcely
      removed by a missive from her noble sire, which informed her indeed of the
      triumph of his arms, but at the same time only casually mentioned that the
      head of the rival house of St. Aunay had received a blow from which he
      would never recover. Now, it was obvious that this might be interpreted in
      two ways&mdash;either that the young Count had been grievously wounded in
      body, or that the fortunes of his house had been seriously injured. The
      latter was undoubtedly the case; but was the former also true? In this
      state of things uncertainty became madness, and Mathilde felt herself
      almost driven to desperation. This, however, being a condition of mind
      hardly suitable to a Norman lady of rank, she determined not to give way
      to it, but to take measures to relieve her anxiety. She resolved that she
      would, if possible, leave the convent and obtain, somehow or other,
      tidings of the being whom she so tenderly loved. It was not, however, in
      those days, a very easy thing to leave convents just when you pleased. If
      you were rich and well born, you could enter these institutions with but
      little difficulty; but quitting them was a different question altogether.
      Nor do I believe Mathilde would have accomplished her purpose had she not
      chanced to have a great friend in a worthy person who carried on the trade
      of a washerwoman in the town, and was fortunate enough to have secured the
      convent <span class="pagenum"><a name="link112" id="link112"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p112.jpg">112</a></span>custom. Being
      devoted to the Guerre-Ã -mort family, and especially so to the young
      Baroness, this worthy woman agreed to smuggle her out of the convent in a
      large basket of dirty linen, in which pleasant manner she successfully
      carried out her project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once free, the question which Mathilde naturally had to consider was, what
      should she do next? She had forgotten to settle this before leaving her
      late abode, and yet it was a question which must certainly be settled
      without delay. The poor washerwoman, who had incurred great peril by
      assisting the escape of an inmate of a religious house, dared not keep her
      a moment longer than she could avoid, and there was no one in the town to
      whom she could trust herself. Under these circumstances she thought that
      the best thing to be done was to wander forth into the country, and this
      she accordingly did, having made such alterations in her dress as appeared
      necessary to prevent her being recognised as something different from the
      peasant woman for whom she wished to pass. The police were not very
      efficient in those days, and there were no detectives to speak of, so that
      she was not likely to be discovered by such agency. Newspapers also had
      not yet begun, and the advertisement system was unknown; otherwise her
      escape might have been attended with greater difficulties than was
      actually the case. As it was, she walked away from Reading without anybody
      taking the slightest notice of her, and wandered for many miles perfectly
      unmolested.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, as luck would have it, she reached a large farmhouse, and as she
      had by this time become weary and hungry, she followed her natural
      instincts, knocked at <span class="pagenum"><a name="link113" id="link113"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p113.jpg">113</a></span>the door, and
      asked for victuals and leave to rest herself. It was an old woman who
      opened the door, whose husband was the occupier of the farm, and being
      kindly-disposed people, they granted Mathilde&rsquo;s request, allowed her
      to sit down in the kitchen, and gave her a bowl of milk and a large piece
      of brown bread, which she gratefully devoured, and felt much the better
      for it. Then the old couple began to question her about her condition and
      ways of life, and when she had invented some tale about having seen better
      days, and being driven by misfortune to seek a living where she could get
      it, they expressed great pity, and professed themselves very willing to
      assist her in any manner within their power. True, they had not much to
      offer; but the boy who kept the pigs had lately gone off to the wars, and
      if pig-keeping was not beyond her, why, the place was very much at her
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if there was anything which Mathilde disliked, it was a pig. The
      greediness and dirtiness of the animal she deemed objectionable, and
      extended her dislike to it even when cooked and salted. She never touched
      roast pork, avoided it all the more when boiled, abhorred sausages, and
      looked the other way when anybody offered her bacon. But, having no very
      definite idea as to where she could go to if she left the farm, and
      thinking that, at all events, it might serve her as a temporary home until
      something better should turn up, she determined upon accepting the
      generous offer of the worthy couple, and expressed her gratitude in terms
      which increased the favourable opinion they had already formed of her
      manners and character.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night she slept beneath their hospitable roof, and <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link114" id="link114"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p114.jpg">114</a></span>next morning her
      duties were pointed out to her, and she wandered forth upon the side of
      the hill near the farm, in close attendance upon a herd of pigs, to watch
      whom would be her daily duty. Although Mathilde&rsquo;s objection to the
      creatures may have been foolish and unreasonable, it will probably be
      conceded that the pig is not an animal which the majority of mankind would
      choose as a special pet or favourite; and to a person nurtured in the
      luxurious habits of a baronial castle, and trained in the intellectual
      refinement of conventual life, the occupation of keeping pigs on the side
      of a hill could hardly ever be congenial. It is, therefore, not surprising
      that Mathilde found it first monotonous, secondly tiresome, thirdly
      exceedingly disagreeable. She would sit for hours together, grasping in
      both hands her pig-driving stick, and musing upon things far removed from
      considerations of pigs or pork.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nights she would return to the farmhouse, heavy and dispirited, so that
      the old farmer and his wife would rally her on her dejected appearance,
      and declare to each other that she must either be in love, or have
      committed some offence over which she now brooded with remorse. Yet her
      youth appeared to contradict the probability of the latter supposition,
      and she looked them both so straight in the face when she spoke, that the
      old man remarked that no one who did <i>that</i> could be guilty of
      anything serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, it may be supposed that the Baron was not very well pleased
      when the news reached him that his daughter had disappeared. He hurried
      off at once to the convent, and refused for some time to believe that it
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link115" id="link115"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p115.jpg">115</a></span>could really be
      the case. If he had lived a little later there would have been plenty of
      people to suggest to him that Mathilde&rsquo;s disappearance was only an
      invention of the Lady Superior&rsquo;s, and that the poor girl was
      certainly either bricked up alive, or immersed in some dungeon below the
      convent.

    </h4>
    <p>
      As it was, however, that age being comparatively ignorant, the Baron was
      told the simple truth, and actually believed it. His daughter had
      disappeared, and no one was more distressed thereat than the Lady Superior
      herself. The discipline of her convent was so good, and the sisterhood
      were all so much attached to her, that it was with difficulty that she
      could <span class="pagenum"><a name="link116" id="link116"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p116.jpg">116</a></span>bring herself to
      believe that any of them had assisted the runaway to escape; and as to the
      washerwoman, no thought of her connivance ever entered the Lady Superior&rsquo;s
      head. Had it done so, indeed, she would never have believed that a
      daughter of the noble house of Guerre-Ã -mort would have so far demeaned
      herself as to hide in a box of dirty clothes, or wander forth, alone and
      unattended, into the country. The good Lady, never having admitted the god
      of love into her well-regulated breast, did not know his powers, which
      experience has proved to be such as are able to overcome all
      considerations of rank and dignity, and occasionally to make people do
      things even more strange and incongruous than hide in dirty-linen boxes or
      keep pigs on a hill-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron was easily convinced that no blame was to be attributed to his
      saintly relative, but this by no means put an end to his trouble. His
      daughter had gone, and he had no clue whatever to her place of
      concealment. Under these circumstances, he determined that the best thing
      he could do was to consult the powers of magic, who in those days were the
      substitute for our present Rural Police, and occasionally discharged their
      functions in a manner equally satisfactory. Those were not days in which
      witches and warlocks were so common as in earlier ages; but, scattered
      about the country, there were a goodly number of the creatures; and the
      Baron had little difficulty in determining whom to consult.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Witch of Salt Hill was a famous personage in those days. The vicinity
      of Eton and Slough was at that time a favourite resort of witches, who
      used to flit about <span class="pagenum"><a name="link117" id="link117"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p117.jpg">117</a></span>through Windsor
      Forest at nights, and, I suppose, preferred to have their day-residences
      not inconveniently remote therefrom. It is not improbable that they would
      have continued to frequent the neighbourhood down to the present day, but
      for the establishment of the sacred foundation of Eton College. There, as
      we know, the Provost and Fellows have, from the very earliest days of the
      college, been a body of men of singularly holy as well as learned
      reputation. Their blameless and saintly lives have driven evil far from
      the locality in which they dwell, and in the days of which I tell their
      power was already beginning to be felt. It gradually increased until, as I
      say, all witches and warlocks left the neighbourhood, although one of the
      last of them is said to have uttered a prophecy that the powers of evil
      should again return when Eton should be governed by others than her own
      children; and if what I have lately heard be true&mdash;namely, that the
      ancient government by Provost and Fellows has been superseded, and a new
      authority instituted, of which a portion is non-Etonian&mdash;it may be
      that the days of witchcraft will return, and the powers of darkness once
      more inhabit the neighbourhood. All this, however, has nothing to do with
      my present story.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the Baron made up his mind that this was the best course to
      pursue than he rode off to Salt Hill to consult the celebrated witch whom
      I have mentioned. He found her with very little trouble, principally from
      knowing exactly where to look for her, which it is always well to
      ascertain, if you can, before you go in search of any one whom you wish to
      find. There was a very large thorn-tree, growing near a spring <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link118" id="link118"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p118.jpg">118</a></span>at the side of a
      hill, close to which a species of rude cottage had been built into the
      hill, so that it had the appearance of being&mdash;and perhaps was&mdash;the
      way by which those who had the right, and the will to do so, could enter
      into the bowels of the earth. When the witch chose to come forth, she sat
      under the thorn-tree; at other times, those who sought her had to approach
      the door of the cottage, and strive to attract her attention in the best
      way they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Baron arrived near the place, with some dozen of retainers, he
      left his horse with the latter at a short distance from the spot, and
      walked up to the spring alone. The witch was not to be seen outside, so
      the anxious father strode up to the cottage, and would have knocked at the
      door, only there did not happen to be any. The place was built of huge
      stones, and the entrance was through a large hole, left open as if for a
      door, which had never been put up. It was as dark as pitch when you looked
      in, and the Baron, fearless as he was, felt a kind of unpleasant sensation
      stealing over him as he stood opposite the hole. However, he had come on
      business which could not be delayed; so, after a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation, he shouted out at the top of his voice, &ldquo;Halloa! is any
      one within?&rdquo; and waited for a reply. As none came, the Baron
      presently tried again, saying, in an equally loud voice, &ldquo;I am come
      to consult the wise woman of Salt Hill. Is it here she dwells?&rdquo;
      Still no answer came from within, and the haughty Norman stamped
      impatiently on the ground, chafing at the delay which his imperious spirit
      could have ill brooked at any time, but which was more than ever galling
      at the present moment, when his anxiety about his <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link119" id="link119"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p119.jpg">119</a></span>daughter had
      thrown him into a state of feverish irritation and excitement. He doubted
      as to the next step which he should take, and was just considering whether
      he had omitted any form which ought to have been observed in approaching
      such a person as a witch, when a voice suddenly spoke from within the
      cottage, saying, in a somewhat gruff voice&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Who comes to Salt Hill&rsquo;s ancient dame?
Tell both thine errand and thy name.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Now the Baron was little accustomed to be addressed so unceremoniously, or
      to be asked his name in this manner, so his first impulse was to refuse to
      reply, or at least to rebuke the speaker for the incivility of the
      question. However, as he had come on important business, and was really
      desirous of obtaining information as to his beloved daughter, a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection convinced him that it would be an act of folly on his part to
      fly into a passion about a trifle, or to stand upon ceremony with a power
      which might be able to assist him, and willing to do so or not according
      to his own behaviour. So he made up his mind to tell his name and errand
      at once, and was about to do so, when, even whilst he hesitated, the voice
      spoke again:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Our Norman lords are men of war,
And love their foemen to defy;
But, come he here from near or far,
Who with the Guerre-Ã -mort can vie?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At this unexpected mention of his own name, the Baron started back, but
      immediately recovering himself, he spoke in as reverential a tone as he
      could manage to find for the occasion. &ldquo;Since thou knowest who I am,
      good <span class="pagenum"><a name="link120" id="link120"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p120.jpg">120</a></span>dame,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;mine errand is very likely also known to thee. I want my
      beloved daughter, who has disappeared from the convent at Reading, and can
      nowhere be found. If thou canst find her for me and restore her to mine
      arms, I will grudge thee no reward that my castle can give.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words a low sigh proceeded from the interior of the cottage, as
      if the offer of a bribe had given pain to its virtuous inmate, or the
      Baron&rsquo;s request had been of an unexpected and afflicting character.
      However, after a few moments&rsquo; pause, the same voice again spoke:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Whi&rsquo;st on this earth we live and move,
Some sweetness in our lives is found;
But what more sweet than children&rsquo;s love,
Our very heart-strings twined around?

Yet to each parent comes an hour
(Though fain he would the same delay)
When other and resistless power
Will steal the youthful heart away.

And when a father here inquires
For daughter lost; then, let him learn
That daughters, though they love their sires,
To other loves some day will turn;

Nor convent rules nor home&rsquo;s own charms,
Will keep them from a lover&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As the voice uttered these strange and not altogether consoling words, the
      Baron stroked his beard, pulled his moustache, and racked his brains in
      the vain endeavour to bring to mind any lover with whom it was at all
      likely that his daughter should have eloped. The idea of her eloping at
      all was unpleasant; but those were strange times, and he knew well enough
      that such things had happened before, and would not improbably happen
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link121" id="link121"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p121.jpg">121</a></span>again. The
      puzzle to him was as to the happy-individual upon whom Mathilde could
      possibly have placed her affections. He thought of all their
      acquaintances, turning over in his mind the circumstances under which his
      child had met them, and, one after the other, he rejected the possibility
      of any one of them being the favoured individual. There was Baron
      Eau-de-vie, who lived within calling distance, but his habits of
      intemperance put him at once out of the question; then the lord of Burnham
      was a worthy man, but being past eighty, and totally blind, was scarcely
      likely to have become the object of a maiden&rsquo;s affection; these and
      various others he thought over, and remained musing for a short time
      before he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it came into his head that perhaps it was all false after all, and
      the witch was either chaffing him, or knew nothing about it at all, and
      was making a guess at a solution of his difficulty, which, however likely
      to be correct as regarded the generality of young ladies, was most
      improbable with respect to a damsel of high degree, so well and carefully
      brought up as he considered his child to have been. As this thought struck
      him, he spoke out aloud at once. &ldquo;What meanest thou?&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;Men will woo, and girls will have lovers, as we all know
      full well; but to suppose that the young Baroness of Guerre-Ã -mort would
      fly from her convent with any lover that ever was born is an error and an
      insult to boot. Trifle not with me, then, whoever thou art, but tell me
      truly, an thou knowest, what has really become of my daughter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A low laugh issued from the cottage as the same voice replied to this
      appeal with the following words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Oh mighty are Barons in battle array,
Full swift are their steeds and full sharp are their swords;
But the heart of a maiden must have its own way,
And Love is far stronger than Barons and Lords.

He climbs the high walls of the castle so strong,
In vain your defences your treasure to shield;
To words which are whispered by lover&rsquo;s true tongue,
The peeress and peasant will equally yield.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This <span class="pagenum"><a name="link122" id="link122"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p122.jpg">122</a></span>reply was by no
      means more satisfactory to the Baron than the first had been, and he saw
      that there was evidently but little information to be obtained from the
      Witch of Salt Hill. Turning away, therefore, with a moody air, he rejoined
      his servants, mounted his steed, and returned to his castle, very much
      disgusted with his want of success. Scarcely had he left the place before
      the head of an old woman peered forth from the entrance of the cottage,
      and presently the whole figure followed. It was that of an aged crone,
      clad in a long grey cloak, with a strange head-covering of handkerchiefs
      twined in the form of a turban, from which a few grey locks escaped and
      fluttered in the wind around the venerable head. She held in her hand a
      strong staff, upon which she leaned, whilst she carefully looked right and
      left to make sure that her visitors had all departed. As soon as she had
      convinced herself of this fact, she turned round again to the entrance of
      the cottage and called in a low voice&mdash;&ldquo;It is quite safe; come
      forth, my lord, come forth!&rdquo; Upon this there was a movement inside
      the place, and there presently stepped forth a young man, the pallor of
      whose handsome countenance betokened recent illness, and who supported
      himself upon a stout oaken staff. Had the Baron stood where he had been
      standing but a few <span class="pagenum"><a name="link123" id="link123"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p123.jpg">123</a></span>minutes before,
      he would scarcely have departed so easily, for in this individual he would
      have seen the hereditary enemy of his house standing close beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, Brother Rhine, the witch of Salt Hill had been, somehow or
      other, greatly indebted to the St. Aunay family; and after Count Horace
      had been wounded in his skirmish with the Baron, he had found a secure
      retreat in her abode at Salt Hill. There, carefully nursed, and perhaps
      doctored by some wondrous charms of which mortals who do not happen to be
      witches know nothing, the young nobleman had rapidly recovered from the
      effects of his wound. The country, however, was still so much under the
      control of the Lancastrian party, that Count Horace deemed it his wisest
      plan to remain for some time in concealment, especially since he found
      that the report of his death had evidently so far softened the Baron that
      he had not pursued his work of devastation as he probably would have done
      if he had believed that the head of the house of St. Aunay was still alive
      and likely to take the field against him upon a favourable opportunity.
      This, then, was the reason of the Count&rsquo;s being in the cottage of
      the witch upon the very day of the Baron&rsquo;s visit, and as soon as the
      latter had departed, the wise woman began to discuss the subject of his
      daughter and her supposed elopement. Whether or not her arts had enabled
      her to discover the direction of Mathilde&rsquo;s flight, and her present
      place of abode, is a question we need hardly pause to ask. It is very
      likely that her statement to the Baron had been little more than a shrewd
      guess that if a young lady fled secretly from a convent, there was in all
      probability <span class="pagenum"><a name="link124" id="link124"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p124.jpg">124</a></span>a gentleman in
      the case, in which surmise she was certainly not far wrong. But if she had
      known where Mathilde was she certainly would not have disclosed it to the
      anxious father whilst St. Aunay was close by, nor indeed under any
      circumstances without the consent of the latter. He had informed her fully
      of the true state of the case between the young Baroness and himself, and
      after the Baron had gone off, eagerly inquired of her as to where the fair
      lady was really to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now witches, although exceedingly wise, cannot tell more than they know,
      and are not obliged to tell all that they <i>do</i> know, except under
      extraordinary circumstances, therefore the witch of Salt Hill thought it
      best to assume a very grave and solemn air, and mysteriously assured her
      friend that all would be right, and that he would know everything that
      ought to be known as soon as the proper time for knowing it had arrived.
      This assurance was scarcely satisfactory to the young man, who pressed
      hard for an answer which should at least give him some indication of the
      course which he had better pursue in order to obtain tidings of the lost
      one. No such answer, however, could he obtain; and all that the old dame
      would tell him was to &ldquo;keep his heart up,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;have
      patience&rdquo;&mdash;two pieces of advice which are excellent in
      themselves, but little calculated to allay the impatience of a young man
      who has lost his sweetheart and wants to find her as soon as possible.
      Patience the young Count found it impossible to have, and, finding himself
      very much better the next day, he determined to set out and see what he
      could accomplish by his own exertions.

      href="../44425-page-images/p125.jpg">125</a></span>was a lovely
      morning, and as St. Aunay walked through the fields, he felt new life
      rising in his&rsquo; veins, and his whole being seemed reinvigorated by
      the bright sun and fresh air. He walked for miles without any very
      definite idea as to where he was going or what he should do, in which it
      will be observed he strongly resembled the condition of his beloved
      Mathilde. Still, disguised in the garb of a peasant, he wandered on, and
      towards evening reached no other place than the very farm at which the
      young Baroness was employed as a pig-keeper. Nor was this his only piece
      of good fortune, for, as luck would have it, he came upon the fair damsel
      herself, disconsolately sitting by the side of her pigs, and wishing
      herself anywhere else. This wish, as may easily be imagined, was
      immediately changed when she found that the strange peasant who approached
      was no other than her own Horace. She flew into his arms with the smallest
      possible delay, and he was forthwith able satisfactorily to explain to her
      that he was by no means dead, and almost entirely recovered from his
      wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospects of the two lovers did not, however, seem particularly bright
      even after they had thus met; and after a long discussion they could
      hardly make up their minds what would be the best course to pursue.
      Mathilde had the greatest objection to returning home, where she should
      hear nothing but abuse of her Horace and his family, not improbably
      coupled with reproaches directed against herself for having quitted the
      convent. To return to the latter was out of the question, and equally so
      to accompany the Count, who had no home to which he could take her. The
      only conclusion, therefore, at which <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link126" id="link126"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p126.jpg">126</a></span>they found
      themselves able to arrive was that the lady had better continue her
      pig-keeping at least for a time, and that they should both wait patiently
      until better days. This arrangement though not exactly pleasant to either
      of them, seemed most expedient upon the whole, and having finally come to
      the determination that such was the case, they took an affectionate leave
      of each other, and again separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day Mathilde passed several months of weary suspense, being
      quite unable to content herself with the unusual pastime of looking after
      pigs, although she found some consolation in reading and writing&mdash;two
      accomplishments in which she had become tolerably perfect during her stay
      in the convent. Books, however, were, not in those days what they now are,
      and those young ladies who depend for their literary amusement upon
      circulating libraries and sensation novels, may thank the good fortune
      which decreed that they should come into the world some few centuries
      later than the days I speak of. Mathilde had one vast book of curious
      manuscript, which she had discovered in the farmhouse, and which was her
      constant companion. I am not sure as to the subjects of which it treated,
      but as it was probably of monkish compilation, it is most likely that it
      dealt either with the lives of saints or the theories of cookery, which
      were two subjects much in favour with the Eccelesiastical fraternities of
      that day. Whatever it was however, Mathilde made it the subject of her
      constant study, and varied her amusement by the use of the quill pens
      which she manufactured, from the good farmer&rsquo;s geese. You must not
      ask me questions, Brother Rhine, as to the manner in which she obtained
      paper and <span class="pagenum"><a name="link127" id="link127"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p127.jpg">127</a></span>ink. None of
      these particulars have ever been handed down, and I have never cared to
      inquire. I can only say that in a certain noble family a huge scroll,
      covered with curious writing, has been long preserved, which tradition
      attributes to the ancestress who once kept pigs on that. Berkshire
      hill-side; and if the tradition is not strictly true, I would merely
      observe that it is just as provable as many another, upon the veracity of
      which the scoffer has never ventured to cast a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time the Baron de Guerre-Ã -mort was not sitting idly at home.
      He made every inquiry for his daughter, and was exceedingly vexed at his
      total want of success in discovering where she was. It is likely enough
      that he would have found her if she had been further off or more carefully
      concealed. But it may be observed as a rule which obtains pretty
      generally, that the things which are immediately under our noses escape
      our observation more than those which require a careful search. A hare
      sometimes squats-securely in the middle of a ploughed field whilst the
      sportsman is seeking her in the thick wood; the nest of the grey thrush,
      built in the bare cleft of a laurel-tree, often escapes the eye of the
      school-boy more easily than the nest more carefully hidden in the thick
      bushes; or, to take another comparison an elderly gentleman sometimes
      makes entirely ineffectual search for the spectacles which he has pushed
      up from his nose to his forehead, whereas, had they been hidden among
      papers, or left in some unusual place, he would quickly have discovered
      them. So it was, at any rate, that the Baron sought far and wide for his
      daughter without success, whilst she, poor girl, was keeping pigs on the
      hill-side all the time, a very <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link128" id="link128"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p128.jpg">128</a></span>few miles
      distant from the castle of her respected parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man, however, found that before long he had other business to
      attend to than the agreeable occupation of daughter-hunting. The fortunes
      of the two great parties in the state underwent a considerable change.
      Instead of being any longer in the ascendant, the Lancastrians experienced
      heavy reverses, and those who had espoused the cause of the House of York
      gained ground continually on every side. In those times it was not so easy
      to change one&rsquo;s politics or one&rsquo;s party as has been the case
      in some later periods of the history of this country, especially if one
      had supported one&rsquo;s opinions by the carrying of fire and sword into
      the territory of one&rsquo;s opponents. Therefore the old Baron, who, as
      we have seen, had adopted this old-fashioned method of proceeding, would
      have found it somewhat difficult to change sides even if he had wished to
      do so. Nothing, however, could have been further from his intention. He
      believed the cause of the House of Lancaster to be just and right, and
      even if he had thought otherwise, I do not believe that he would ever have
      deserted a cause which he had once thoroughly espoused. So he remained
      loyal to the Lancastrian standard, and was as ready to fight for it in
      adversity as he had ever been when it seemed likely to triumph. The
      consequences, however, were not likely to be agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Yorkists were daily gathering strength, and so devoted an adherent of
      the rival house could hardly escape their kind attention. Moreover, those
      who had seen their own homes despoiled by the Baron&rsquo;s invasion were
      not unmindful of their oppressor when the opportunity <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link129" id="link129"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p129.jpg">129</a></span>for revenge
      appeared to present itself. So it came about that the Baron&rsquo;s
      position was somewhat precarious. Some of his outlying farms were
      plundered; his retainers, when caught singly or in small numbers, were
      insulted and rudely treated, and threats of something worse likely to
      happen occasionally reached his ears. As yet, however, no armed body of
      Yorkists had appeared in the neighbourhood, and the strength of his
      castle, as well as the number and devotion of his followers, rendered the
      Baron de Guerre-Ã -mort tolerably secure against any attack save one from a
      powerful and well-organized force. Still he could see the storm lowering
      in the distance, and gathering in strength sufficient to give him cause
      for uneasiness. At last it seemed ready to burst. Small bands of Yorkists
      had been reported as hovering about various places in the vicinity of the
      castle, and rumour now had it that these bands were likely to be united at
      Reading under the command of some leader of note, who would forthwith
      proceed to march through Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, putting down all
      those who still dared to uphold the falling fortunes of the House of
      Lancaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this time the Baron had remained within his castle walls, gloomily
      watching the signs of the times, and only taking precautions to preserve
      the efficiency of his troops by constant drill, and to protect his
      fortress and people against possible attack. But as soon as the
      above-mentioned rumours became well authenticated, he bethought himself
      that some more active steps should be taken. If the enemy should once
      concentrate his forces at Reading, he would probably carry all before him,
      and resistance would be doubly difficult, if not impossible. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link130" id="link130"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p130.jpg">130</a></span>But if such
      concentration could be prevented, and the various bodies of Yorkists, who
      were said to be scattered over the face of the country, could be attacked
      and routed in detail, the tide might even yet be turned, and the drooping
      flag of Lancaster be once more raised as high as ever. Animated by such
      thoughts as these, and determined, if possible, to carry out the plan
      which appeared to him, and which probably was, the best under the
      circumstances, the Baron summoned his men, and leaving a small detachment
      to guard the castle, sallied forth with the intention of cutting off the
      advance of the Yorkists upon Reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult, however, for one body of men, unless greatly superior in
      numbers, position, and generalship, to act with success against four or
      five, and so it happened that before he had been many days in the field
      the Baron de Guerre-Ã -mort found that he had before him a task beyond his
      powers. A detachment of Yorkists was marching from Oxford, whilst at the
      same moment another party moved from Windsor; and from the direction of
      Basingstoke in one quarter, and Marlborough in another, a third and fourth
      body converged towards the same point. It will be easily understood that
      the Baron now ran no inconsiderable risk in his daring attempt. In the
      first place, he was by no means certain that his army was more numerous
      than any one of the Yorkist parties; and in the second, if he should
      engage and defeat one, he might have another on his flank before he was by
      any means ready to renew the combat. Prudence, therefore, would have
      seemed to dictate a retreat, unless indeed he could be sure of
      encountering his various enemies at the place and moment of his own
      choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such <span class="pagenum"><a name="link131" id="link131"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p131.jpg">131</a></span>was the state of
      things on one lovely day in June, when Mathilde was engaged in her usual
      employment, which day by day grew more irksome to her as time wore on. She
      was seated under a tree, shading herself from the rays of the summer sun,
      her pen held listlessly in her hand, her scroll and book by her side,
      whilst she mused on the past, made plans for the future, and forgot the
      present, after the custom of persons when pretty comfortably seated and
      rather sleepily inclined. A distant noise aroused her from her reverie
      after a time, and as it drew nearer and nearer she knew but too well that
      she heard the shouts of men engaged in battle, and that one of those
      struggles was taking place which at that time, alas! were but too common
      in unhappy England.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the tree under which she was seated she commanded an extensive view
      over the plain below, and ere long she was able to discern the contending
      forces as they issued from a pass between the hills, one party being
      apparently driven before the other. In the plain they rallied, and a
      desperate combat appeared to be going on; then, whilst the wave of men
      surged to and fro, horse and foot apparently mingled in an
      undistinguishable mass, a third body appeared upon the scene, marching
      round the base of one of the hills, and joining themselves to those who
      had first emerged from the pass. For a time all was confusion and clamour,
      and, amid the dust and din, Mathilde could make out nothing as to the
      exact character of the combatants. Presently, however, a light breeze
      lifted the dust, and she had a clearer view of the sight before her eyes.
      The reinforcements which had just arrived had at once altered the <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link132" id="link132"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p132.jpg">132</a></span>fortunes of the
      battle, and the party which had at first driven its opponents victoriously
      before it was now evidently giving way. It needed no second glance to tell
      which was the winning side, for the banner of the white rose floated on
      high, and triumphant shouts of &ldquo;A York! a York!&rdquo; rent the air.

    </h4>
    <p>
      Baffled and beaten, the Lancastrians vainly endeavoured to hold together;
      slowly but surely they gave way before the pressure of superior numbers,
      and it was evident that the question was now only between an orderly
      retreat and an utter rout. Straining her eyes to the utmost, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link133" id="link133"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p133.jpg">133</a></span>Mathilde beheld
      at the head of the retreating party a tall and martial figure which she
      recognised but too clearly. Conspicuous among the throng by his height and
      noble bearing, and carrying him right gallantly even when matters were
      going so decidedly against him, the noble old Baron little knew whose eyes
      were fixed upon him with eager and agonized gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment I doubt whether Mathilde had a thought even for the lover
      for whose sake she had suffered so much; her father, the fond parent who
      had nurtured her from earliest infancy, upon whose knees she had sat and
      prattled, whose eyes had never lighted on her save with glances of tender
      love, whose conduct towards her had been one continued indulgence from the
      first hour of her recollection,&mdash;the father, moreover, whom she had
      selfishly left to live alone and bear his solitary lot in the world
      without his idolised child&mdash;that father was now in peril of his life,
      and probably about to perish before the very eyes of his ungrateful
      daughter. There she saw him, the brave old man, sitting upon his charger
      as if he were part of the animal, dealing blows right and left with the
      strength and vigour of a far younger man, parrying strokes aimed with
      right good will at his devoted head, and ever and anon shielding from
      attack some wounded follower, and covering the retreat of some retiring
      friends. And whilst the battle raged furiously around him, ever and anon
      the old man raised his war-cry aloud, &ldquo;A Guerre-Ã -mort! a
      Guerre-Ã -mort!&rdquo; and at each cry it seemed as if a new spirit
      animated his yielding troops, and with fresh energy they rallied and made
      head against the superior forces of their opponents. But the fight was too
      unequal to last. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link134" id="link134"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p134.jpg">134</a></span>That had
      happened which might have been anticipated. The Baron had attacked and
      partially routed a Yorkist band, when another party, directed by the
      shouts of battle, had hastened from their line of march and arrived in
      time to take part in the fray, and to throw a great preponderance of
      numbers on the side of the cause for which they fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron strove in vain to perform an impossibility, and to convert
      defeat into victory. His men fell fast by his side, and he was soon left
      almost alone, surrounded by the triumphant enemy. Mathilde could bear the
      sight no longer, and, covering her face with her hands, burst into a flood
      of tears. But even thus the suspense was too terrible to bear. Presently,
      she lifted her eyes, and beheld the Lancastrians scattering in headlong
      flight, pursued by the triumphant partisans of the House of York. But
      where, oh! where was her father? She had not far to look. The old horse
      she knew so well lay dead upon the plain, but around him were clustered a
      group of men, evidently still engaged in some fierce conflict. In another
      moment they fell back, and she perceived a figure recumbent upon the
      ground, whilst a second figure stood over it, not to destroy, but to guard
      it from the blows of others. Could she&mdash;was it possible that she
      could&mdash;be mistaken? No: it was as she thought and hoped&mdash;her own
      Horace standing over the prostrate body of her father, was guarding his
      hereditary enemy from the destroying Yorkists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye, so it was indeed, Brother Rhine, nor was this the first nor the last
      instance where love has proved stronger than hate in this curious world,
      and where chivalrous and valiant men have respected in others the bravery
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link135" id="link135"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p135.jpg">135</a></span>which they so
      well knew how to practise themselves. St. Aunay was the commander of the
      Yorkist party who had turned the tide of that day&rsquo;s battle.
      Recognising his ancient foe, he would no doubt have sought him out with
      every intention of then and there taking his revenge for the past, had it
      not been for the special reasons which induced him to adopt a contrary
      course of proceeding. He watched, with an admiration which it was
      impossible to withhold, the gallant behaviour of the old nobleman when
      fighting against fearful odds. He refrained from interference whilst it
      could do no good; but when he saw the Baron&rsquo;s horse slain by the
      thrust of a pike, and its rider thrown upon the ground, he rushed forward
      to protect the fallen leader from those who would otherwise very speedily
      have disposed of him after a ruthless fashion. It was no easy or pleasant
      task; for the soldiery were excited by the stubborn resistance of the old
      Baron, and St. Aunay had to strike, strongly and fiercely, before he could
      rescue his foe from his own friends. He succeeded, however, and, in a few
      moments, the Baron, who had been partially stunned, as well by his fall,
      as by several blows by no means of a light character, which he had
      received in spite of St. Aunay&rsquo;s efforts for his preservation, rose
      from the ground without having sustained any such vital injury as had
      recently appeared to be almost inevitable. Bitter, however, were his
      feelings when he discovered to whom it was that he owed his life; for so
      deeply had the family feud become engraven upon his heart, that it is
      almost doubtful whether he would not have preferred death, to escape
      therefrom by means of the aid of a St. Aunay.
    </p>
    <p>
      There <span class="pagenum"><a name="link136" id="link136"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p136.jpg">136</a></span>was no time,
      however, for much to be said on either side. The Yorkists were pursuing
      their flying foes, and but few were left around the two noblemen, when
      from the hill-side, but a short distance off, they beheld a female figure
      hurrying towards them with eager gestures and evident excitement. Both
      recognised her at the same moment&mdash;both hastened to meet her&mdash;and
      in a brief space of time Mathilde was once more folded to her father&rsquo;s
      heart. Horace de St. Aunay could have wished that another breast had been
      the resting-place, but could hardly have expected it under the peculiar
      circumstances. He waited patiently, therefore (having no other reasonable
      alternative), until the father and daughter had indulged their natural
      affection for each other, and had entered upon certain mutual
      explanations, which appeared upon the whole to be satisfactory. Then the
      Baron turned to him, and for some time was unable to utter a word. The
      struggle was severe in his heart between his natural affection for his
      child and his cherished hatred for the foe of his house. But, luckily for
      all parties, the former prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron was no fool, and probably felt that if Mathilde had run away
      once to look for her lover, it was exceedingly likely that she might do it
      again. Moreover, the Lancastrian cause was now in that condition that
      those who still upheld it would ere long have nothing else to uphold, and,
      whatever might become of himself, the old Baron had no desire to see his
      beloved daughter dispossessed of her patrimony, and possibly driven from
      house and home, or reduced to that employment as a necessity which she had
      recently adopted as a temporary&mdash;though most uncongenial&mdash;occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link137" id="link137"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p137.jpg">137</a></span>like a sensible
      man, he allowed his reason and common sense to overcome his prejudice, and
      gave his consent to his daughter&rsquo;s marriage with the Count of St.
      Aunay. He could not have done a wiser thing. The Count&rsquo;s influence
      with the winning party in the state was naturally considerable, and was
      efficiently exercised in favour of his father-in-law, who was allowed to
      retain his castle and property, when others, less fortunate in their
      daughters&rsquo; marriages, lost both on account of their political
      opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace and Mathilde were speedily united, and, as old story-books usually
      say, &ldquo;they lived very happily all the rest of their lives.&rdquo; It
      will also be doubtless satisfactory to you to know that none of the
      convent authorities ever discovered that the old washerwoman had had
      anything whatever to do with the disappearance of the young Baroness; that
      the farmer and his wife were liberally rewarded for their kindness to the
      latter; and that the followers and believers in the Witch of Salt Hill had
      a higher opinion than ever of her supernatural powers, since it had so
      plainly been proved that it was, as she had said, on account of a lover
      that the Baron&rsquo;s daughter had left the convent. And this is the way
      that there came a happy termination to &ldquo;The Family Feud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Thames here paused, and took a deep draught of ale; whilst he was
      engaged with which, his brother of the Rhine calmly and gravely put to him
      the singular question: &ldquo;And what became of the pigs, Brother Thames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The potentate of our English river hastily put down his <span

      violently as he did so, and then answered with a laugh, &ldquo;Confound
      your jokes, Brother Rhine, you made my liquor go the wrong way, which is a
      very unpleasant thing, let me tell you. But, after all, the rebuke was
      deserved, for my cross-questioning you so closely after your last legend.
      I own that legends are things which should be received with much faith and
      no questions, or the beauty of them is lost at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; responded he of the Rhine, &ldquo;and
      it was with the object of bringing you to express your concurrence in this
      view that I asked the remarkably stupid question about the pigs. There are
      some people who always want to know a great deal more than is good for
      them, and who insist upon asking what became of each and every character
      of whom mention has been made in a legend. This is simply ridiculous, and
      very disagreeable to the teller of the story, who is obliged to introduce
      many minor characters into his tale, in order to fill up gaps, and
      illustrate the position of the principal personages, but who cannot be
      expected to know the final history and eventual fate of them all. Since,
      then, you agree with me, Brother Thames, I shall ask you to be good enough
      to listen to my next legend with a sincere determination to believe it if
      you can, and in any case to demand no explanation of circumstances which
      may seem strange, or with regard to persons who may appear to be unusual
      in name or character, or in both the two together.&rdquo;

      request, upon which the other commenced at once as follows:&mdash;

      THE GIANT BRAMBLE-BUFFER

      Daddyroarer&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce is a Daddyroarer?&rdquo; hastily interposed Father
      Thames.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monarch of the Rhine gave him an indignant glance. &ldquo;Is this the
      way you keep your promise?&rdquo; he inquired, in a tone of some severity.
      &ldquo;Another such interruption and I shall decline to continue the
      amusement of legend-telling. I have no objection, however, to inform you
      that the word Daddyroarer signifies a giant, though whence its derivation
      I am unable to tell you with any degree of certainty. It probably comes
      from two Teutonic words, but I should be sorry to attempt to give them in
      the original. There is something about the name, however, which conveys
      the idea of a giant. &lsquo;Daddy,&rsquo; indeed, being the familiar
      appellation by which children occasionally designate their male parent,
      points, not so much to the paternal relationship of a giant with mankind,
      as to his size and proportions, which are as much larger than those of man
      as are the proportions and size of a father to those of his young
      children. I presume that the term &lsquo;roarer&rsquo; is not intended to
      convey, as in the case of a horse, the notion of broken wind, but has
      rather reference to the gruff and deep-toned voice which usually
      characterizes the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, be this as it may, I repeat the fact that there was once a
      certain Daddyroarer, or giant, who lived among the mountains near a
      certain part of my beautiful river. For many years, indeed, in the old,
      old times, the men of Rhineland were grievously troubled with giants <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link140" id="link140"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p140.jpg">140</a></span>of different
      sorts and sizes. Tradition tells us that they all sprang from the mighty
      giant Senoj, who, as is well known, was born, nobody knows how or where,
      among the loftiest peaks of the Alps, and is down to this day popularly
      known in Rhineland as the father of all giants.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain it is that his descendants, if such they were, proved
      exceedingly troublesome to mankind in general, and Rhenish mankind in
      particular. These creatures were, indeed, a plague and a pest to the
      country. They ate voraciously, and were not particular as to the food with
      which they satisfied their appetites. I am not prepared to say whether or
      no they were actually cannibals, and will therefore give them the benefit
      of the doubt; nevertheless, they were exceedingly unpleasant neighbours.
      The quantity of food which they required was alone sufficient to have
      placed this fact beyond question, for if you recollect the feats performed
      in the way of swallowing by your own old giant&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
'Robin-a-bobbin-a-Bilberry Ben,
Who ate more victuals than three-score men,&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      and consider what would have been the effect upon your country of
      half-a-dozen Robins, you will have no trouble in understanding the
      difficulty which Rhineland experienced in supporting these worthies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made it much worse, too, was the exceedingly loose notions
      which these beings entertained upon the subject of the rights of property.
      They apparently laboured under the delusion that the world was made for
      giants, and for giants alone&mdash;a theory exceedingly convenient for
      those who happened to be giants, but the reverse <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link141" id="link141"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p141.jpg">141</a></span>of agreeable to
      those who did not come within that somewhat limited category. These
      excellent individuals took exactly what they pleased from its owner,
      without so much as &lsquo;by your leave&rsquo; or &lsquo;with your leave,&rsquo;
      and never for a moment dreamed of paying the value of the article in
      question. This was not a comfortable state of things for the people of the
      land, who saw their sheep and oxen, pigs and poultry, and other
      possessions which they prized, taken away by the great bullies against
      whom they dared not lift a voice nor wag a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this was not all. It is bad enough to be robbed by another
      person, and not pleasant to be assaulted, but I am not sure whether to be
      utterly ignored and despised is not worse than either, especially when
      accompanied by such aggravating circumstances as those to which I am now
      going to allude. These huge creatures used to go walking about just as if
      there were no such things as men and women in the world. They would kick
      over a cottage for fun, sit down upon a barn or outhouse and crush its
      roof with their weight, out of mere ignorance or wanton folly; and even
      now and then set their foot on a human being and crush him into the earth,
      as if he were a snake, taking no account whatever of his prayers and
      struggles. In fact, they got into the habit of treating people as if they
      were merely an inferior part of creation placed upon the earth to
      cultivate and make it more useful for giants, and intended to be robbed,
      maltreated, trodden under foot, and put out of the way, just when and how
      it suited their imperious masters, for whom, and for whose sake alone, the
      universe had been created.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <span class="pagenum"><a name="link142" id="link142"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p142.jpg">142</a></span>may well
      imagine, Brother Thames, that this state of affairs was pre-eminently
      unsatisfactory to my poor people. No man&rsquo;s life or property was
      secure, and all improvement was entirely prevented. Indeed, what was the
      use of building a house which was liable to be knocked down or kicked over
      by a giant at any moment? Of what avail would it have been to plant a
      field with wheat, oats, or barley, when at any and every period of the
      year all might be trodden down by the ruthless foot of the same monster,
      and the reapers possibly be stamped into the ground, together with the
      crops which they were gathering? Who would rear sheep and oxen of which he
      was sure to be robbed? and who would spend time, labour, and money upon
      anything when all was so insecure and uncertain? So it came about that the
      population diminished, no houses were built, few fields were sown, lands
      went out of cultivation, and it seemed as if, in a little time longer, the
      country would be neither more nor less than a dreary wilderness. Indeed,
      the whole face of the country was changed by the strange freaks of the
      Daddyroarers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes they would amuse themselves by lifting huge masses of
      rock, and therewith building a mountain; at another time they would fling
      enormous stones at each other in sport, which was pastime anything but
      delightful to their neighbours, whose lives and property were thereby
      grievously imperilled. And not the least part of the mischief they did was
      when they took a fancy to snowball each other, which the survivors of them
      still practise, especially in some parts of Switzerland, where the
      avalanche, which occasionally overwhelms the unhappy traveller, although
      mistakenly attributed to natural <span class="pagenum"><a name="link143"
      id="link143"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p143.jpg">143</a></span>causes,
      is in reality nothing more than the fall of a larger snowball than usual,
      hurled by the mighty arm of one of those mountain giants.

      &ldquo;At the time I speak of there was one particular giant who had for a
      long while been remarkably troublesome. Not only was his appetite more
      insatiable than that of his brethren, but he was endowed with a spirit of
      mischief, which rendered him an especially disagreeable neighbour. If he
      met a man he generally gave him a kick, which sent him off fifty yards up
      in the air, and in most instances proved fatal. He never passed a cottage
      without sitting down on the roof, or kicking the wall down, and would walk
      away from a farm with a couple of haystacks, one under each arm, simply
      for the love of plunder, and when he really did not require the hay for
      his own purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <span class="pagenum"><a name="link144" id="link144"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p144.jpg">144</a></span>will hardly
      require much argument in order to convince you that this giant was a most
      obnoxious person, and was consequently held in great detestation by all
      the poor creatures who had the misfortune to dwell near him. By these he
      was generally called by the euphonious name of &lsquo;Old Bramble-Buffer,&rsquo;
      although the title by which he was known among his own kith and kin was
      probably quite different, and has not been handed down to posterity. For
      many years he tyrannized over the country round, and the story which I am
      about to tell you will show how great his fame and physical strength must
      have been, and thus remove any surprise which you might otherwise possibly
      have felt at the power of one monster to keep a whole neighbourhood in
      subjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When their houses had been again and again destroyed, the wretched
      inhabitants began to seek shelter in holes in the caves and rocks, in
      which they hid themselves, their wives, families, and effects, and only
      issued forth by stealth at night, or when they had reason to believe that
      their terrible oppressor was away from home. In consequence of this state
      of things, our friend the Daddyroarer found his fun somewhat diminished.
      He seldom encountered a man now, the opportunities afforded him for
      kicking down houses were comparatively rare, and he began to think life in
      the country, under such circumstances, rather tedious. It was in vain that
      he occupied himself in mountain-building with some of his fellow-giants,
      snowballing was cold work, and became tiresome after a time; and when he
      once tried to amuse himself by baling out my river, he found the task too
      great for even one of his gigantic strength. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link145" id="link145"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p145.jpg">145</a></span>He kept on at it
      for some time, being too stupid to understand that my river, being well
      supplied at its sources, and aided by many a tributary stream and mountain
      torrent, was in no sort of way affected by the abstraction of the few
      millions of gallons of which his puny efforts robbed it, and his exertions
      only caused intense mirth to my elves and demons, without for a moment
      lessening the volume of water in the river, or in any way diminishing the
      strength and rapidity of the current.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So when Master Bramble-buffer became tired of all these occupations
      and amusements he had few resources left. Persons of his description are
      not given to literary or intellectual pursuits, and in all probability
      both reading and writing were accomplishments entirely unknown to the
      ordinary class of giants. Eating, drinking, and sleeping appeared to be
      the chief objects for which these creatures existed, except to make
      themselves generally disagreeable to their neighbours, which was an object
      in which it is quite true that they rarely failed to achieve complete
      success. So when the excellent Bramble-buffer had found out that the task
      of emptying the Rhine was beyond his powers, and cared not to fall back
      upon the old pastimes, of which he had had his fill, he took to the
      practice of taking long walks, and journeying into other countries wherein
      he might find fresh people to terrify, new fields to destroy, and a wider
      scope for the exercise of his vast strength and malevolent disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He marched over a great extent of ground, and did a vast deal of
      mischief during these excursions. Such was his size and weight, that the
      commonest action on his part <span class="pagenum"><a name="link146"
      id="link146"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p146.jpg">146</a></span>was
      sometimes fraught with the most unexpected results and the direst
      consequences to mankind. For instance, if he carelessly slung his
      walking-stick as he moved along the road, the implement, being of the size
      and thickness of a well-grown fir-tree, brushed off the heads of trees&mdash;and
      of people too, for that matter, if it came in contact with them,&mdash;-just
      as a stick in the hand of an ordinary mortal knocks over poppies and
      thistles if employed for that purpose. Then if he sat down on a small hill
      to rest, it was as if a man had jumped with his full weight on a mole-hill
      of which the earth was newly thrown up and consequently soft. The ground
      trembled beneath his weight as if with the shock of a sudden earthquake;
      and very often squashed under him so as to jut out on either side, and
      cause sudden and most inconvenient alterations in the fields and woods on
      each side of the hill, more especially so in those cases in which
      dwellings happened to have been erected thereupon. And woe betide the
      owner of ponds or wells when the Daddyroarer happened to be thirsty as he
      passed by them. It was no unusual thing for him to empty a pond at a
      draught, and I have known a whole village affected with drought for weeks
      together because old Bramble-buffer had taken a fancy to drink of the
      wells by which it was supplied with water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his journey at last the old fellow came to the seashore, and
      having never before visited the blue ocean, he was abundantly delighted at
      all he saw. Even the coarse and blunted nature of a giant cannot fail to
      be struck with admiration at the first sight of the glorious sea. The
      waves breaking with regular and solemn force upon the shore, as if
      protesting ever against their enforced <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link147" id="link147"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p147.jpg">147</a></span>restraint within
      prescribed limits: the foam dancing lightly upon the water far away out at
      sea; the bright rays of the sun reflected in varying lights upon the
      shifting waters; the ships riding at anchor, or merrily cleaving the waves
      asunder in their onward course; the sea-birds skimming along the bosom of
      the sea, ever and anon with shrill scream dipping their long wings in the
      spray of the wave, and mounting again in high air with joyous flight; the
      huge fish showing his scaled form for an instant in the light of day, and
      the next moment burying himself fathoms deep in the world of waters below;
      all these things, passing before the eye at the same moment with the
      rapidity of thought, strike the beholder, be he giant or man, with mingled
      awe and wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the case of old Bramble-buffer, however, neither feeling lasted
      long, and after a very short space of time the spirit of mischief arose
      within his breast, and tempted him to try his powers of doing evil under
      the new circumstances before him. Placing himself in a recumbent posture,
      and supporting his huge frame upon his two stalwart arms, he began to blow
      violently down upon the sea below, with all the force of his mighty lungs.
      The effect was instantaneous. The bosom of the deep was troubled as with a
      terrible hurricane. The waves reared up their heads, the foam danced
      higher than ever, the sea-birds shrieked more loudly, and the fishes were
      astonished at the wondrous commotion which had arisen upon the surface of
      their watery home. The poor mariners, who were taken totally unawares by
      the extraordinary suddenness of the storm, were, as may well be supposed,
      in considerable trouble. Their ships were <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link148" id="link148"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p148.jpg">148</a></span>driven from
      their moorings, masts were snapt asunder, sails and rigging rent and
      injured irreparably, and several men and boys blown overboard by the
      violence of the terrible blast. Indeed, more than one vessel was lost, and
      an immense amount of property utterly destroyed; and all because of this
      mad freak of the mischievous old giant.

      &ldquo;But the best of the joke in this case was that the poor mortals had
      no idea whatever of the cause of the disaster which had so unexpectedly
      befallen them, and a lengthy correspondence was carried on in the
      newspapers <span class="pagenum"><a name="link149" id="link149"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p149.jpg">149</a></span>of a certain
      country whose inhabitants think themselves wiser than anybody else, as to
      the cause of storms, the efficacy of storm signals, and the possibility of
      foretelling when the weather is going to be calm or rough. Some people
      wrote letters which appeared to the world exceedingly wise, whilst others
      published ideas which every one agreed to be remarkably foolish, but none
      of them ever hit upon the right cause of this catastrophe, and possibly
      many others of a like character, nor did any person ever dream for a
      moment that the whole of the affair was owing to the whim of old
      Bramble-buffer and his desire to try his strength upon the waves of the
      ocean. When he had accomplished his purpose, put everybody and everything
      into the greatest confusion, and done all the mischief he could in the
      shortest possible time, the fellow sat up, folded his arms, and indulged
      in a series of hearty laughs and strange roars of pleasure which the
      innocent people of the neighbourhood took for claps of thunder, and said
      it was a good thing; that the thunder-storm would clear the air, and the
      wind would soon be lulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giants, however, like men, find pleasures greater in anticipation
      than in realisation, and our old friend thought it too much trouble to
      repeat the experiment of raising the wind, which is one never to be
      performed without a certain amount of difficulty. Accordingly, he resolved
      to seek for some other amusement, and turning away from the sea-shore,
      again penetrated into the interior of the country. It would be endless to
      tell: you all the strange pranks he played, and how gradually his name
      became known and detested throughout the whole country through which the
      river which bears my name holds <span class="pagenum"><a name="link150"
      id="link150"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p150.jpg">150</a></span>its
      course. It he desired notoriety, he certainly had it to his heart&rsquo;s
      content, and never was there a being more feared and hated since the
      beginning of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, having travelled far enough, he returned by easy stages to
      the country from whence he had set out, and there recommenced his old evil
      practices with the smallest possible delay. He had always a spite against
      my beautiful river, I suppose because he had failed in emptying it; but,
      whatever the reason may have been, he liked it not, and used to vary his
      occupations sometimes by pitching pieces of mountain into it, and close by
      its side, so as to make its shores if possible unapproachable by mortal
      foot, in doing which he added greatly to the wild beauty of the scenery,
      without in reality doing the smallest harm either to the river or to
      mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a while, old Bramble-buffer began to find that the effects of
      his bad and cruel conduct towards mankind had so diminished the number of
      those who used to dwell in houses, that he had some difficulty in
      obtaining supplies from farms and homesteads as before. He therefore, much
      against his will, was obliged to take to hunting and trapping wild
      animals, in which he was not very skilful, but for this he was in some
      measure compensated by the advantages of size and strength, which enabled
      him to catch creatures which his skill alone would never have brought
      within reach of his devouring jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his search after game he was in the habit of roaming far and
      wide over the mountains and through the forests of Rhine-land, and his
      loud cries and roars were often heard for miles, sending the frightened
      people into their holes and caves, where with trembling hearts they sought
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link151" id="link151"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p151.jpg">151</a></span>a refuge from
      the mighty Daddyroarer. At last, one day, the old fellow had been more
      than commonly successful in his hunting. Chance had thrown in his way
      several roe-buck and sundry hares, of which he had made a very hearty
      meal, and naturally felt rather sleepy afterwards. He therefore wandered
      slowly through the forest, looking for some convenient and comfortable
      spot upon which he might deposit his huge carcase, and indulge in that
      after-dinner nap which is ordinarily so agreeable to persons of a certain
      age. In a giant&rsquo;s case, such naps are almost always unnaturally long
      and deep, and in fact these vast beings have been known not unfrequently
      to sleep round from one dinnertime to another, when their repast has
      happened to be somewhat larger and more satisfactory to themselves than
      common.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Bramble-buffer looked about, and not seeing any eligible
      resting-place at hand, determined to make one for himself by pulling up a
      tree or two, and so finding a pillow in their roots and the earth which
      would be upturned therewith. So taking hold of a large tree near him, he
      gave it a twist and a turn, such as a gardener might do in pulling up a
      radish, or a labourer in performing the same office upon a turnip, and
      produced precisely the same effect. The tree was uprooted, and remained in
      the hands of its destroyer. But it so happened that this was not an
      ordinary tree, or rather that there were some extraordinary circumstances
      connected with it. It was of very great size, and growing on the side of a
      hill; in which a large cave had been excavated beneath and among the roots
      of the trees, which served as props and supports for the sides and roof of
      the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This <span class="pagenum"><a name="link152" id="link152"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p152.jpg">152</a></span>cave was
      inhabited by a number of unhappy mortals, who had been driven hither by
      the careless cruelty of the great giant, and who little thought that the
      tyranny of their oppressor would follow them even into this dark and
      hidden retreat. They, of course, were thrown into the most terrible
      consternation by his present feat. The uprooting of the tree was to them
      the destruction of their home once more, the ruin of all they loved, the
      literal annihilation of their property, and the loss of all that could
      still make life dear to them. Fancy the miserable, the extraordinary
      results which would happen if one&rsquo;s house were suddenly lifted up,
      and the walls, ceilings, beams, and rafters fell in around us on every
      side. Well, this was precisely what happened to these unfortunate
      creatures. Nor had they the smallest time for preparation. It all came
      upon them in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we have seen, it was only the desire of the giant to provide
      himself with a pillow which caused him to pull up the tree, and although
      he would probably have done so just the same, or perhaps all the more, if
      he had known what the result would be, there is no reason to suppose that
      of such result he had the least idea, or indeed that he ever troubled his
      head about the possible or probable result of his action to anybody but
      himself. As soon, however, as he had pulled up the tree, and perceived the
      effects which he had thus produced, the old rascal burst into a roar of
      laughter. Indeed the sight was probably as amusing to him as it must have
      been horrible to one of the sufferers. The poor little mortals were
      running to and fro, each with the most woebegone expression of
      countenance, unable to make out <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link153" id="link153"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p153.jpg">153</a></span>what had
      happened to them. Some, indeed, were entangled in the roots of the tree,
      and whirled up aloft with it in the giant&rsquo;s hands, some were half
      smothered by the fallen earth, and the rest were endeavouring to make
      their escape best manner that they could to repair the injury he had done,
      or leaving the poor creatures whom he had so cruelly disturbed to repair
      it for themselves if they could.

    <p>
      On the contrary, he made matters worse, and just for the fun of the thing,
      stamped several of the mortals into the earth as they were wildly flying
      from the ruins of their home, and thus put an <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link154" id="link154"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p154.jpg">154</a></span>end to their
      lives and troubles together. Probably, out of mere mischief, he would have
      destroyed more of them, if he had happened to have fallen in with the
      pastime before dinner. Having dined, however, he was much less inclined to
      any active exertion, and therefore contented himself with putting his foot
      upon those who were more immediately within his reach, and then, feeling
      somewhat fatigued, sat down on that very spot and prepared for his usual
      nap. First, however, he indulged in another laugh at the curious incident
      which had just occurred; then he peered down into the cave below, and
      wondered how any living creatures could exist in such a dark, dismal
      place, and what the nature and habits of such creatures could be. This
      being a subject too vast and deep for the intellect of a giant, he could
      not entertain it without giving a tremendous yawn, which still more
      inclined him to sleep. So, arranging his position as comfortably as he
      could upon his back, which is a giant&rsquo;s natural posture when about
      to turn in for the night, he composed himself to slumber, without a
      thought of remorse for the unhappy beings whom he had just treated in so
      ruthless a manner, and in a very short time was buried in the land of
      dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, amongst those who had been driven from the shelter of the
      cave, and rendered houseless and homeless in a moment by the act of the
      giant, was a worthy person of the name of Hans. His other name is unknown
      to me, or at least I have forgotten it at the present moment, which comes
      to much the same thing. Hans had followed the honourable profession of a
      tailor in happier days, before the tyranny of the giant had destroyed
      trade, crippled commerce, and made men careless <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link155" id="link155"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p155.jpg">155</a></span>as to whether
      they wore coats or trousers at all when their whole lives were so full of
      misery and uncertainty. When tailoring, like other handicrafts, thus fell
      into disuse, and men who were homeless and houseless frequently became
      clothes-less also, Hans faced the matter boldly, and lived by his wits
      like the others, making himself exceedingly useful in the cave-life which
      he and his companions found themselves obliged to adopt. No one knew
      better how to arrange the interior of the caves after the best and most
      convenient fashion; no one was more urbane to the men, or more courteous
      and obliging to the women; no one, in short, had proved himself a more
      useful and agreeable companion in that banished community.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having been engaged in some domestic occupation within the cave at
      the time of the misfortune which befell its inmates, Hans bore his full
      share in the general calamity, and indeed only owed his escape with life
      to his activity and presence of mind. Whirled upwards with the tree, he
      clung tightly to the nearest root, and had the wisdom to drop himself just
      at the right moment upon the ground, and run lightly away into the
      brushwood. As soon, however, as the assault was over, and the destroyer of
      his brethren had lain down to sleep, the bold Hans again came forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many men would have fled as far as possible from that scene of
      sorrow and destruction, and thought only of the preservation of their own
      lives from the fate which had befallen so many of their kind. But Hans had
      too much public spirit to take any such selfish course. He descended
      without delay into the cave, and ascertained as well as he could the full
      extent of the damage which had <span class="pagenum"><a name="link156"
      id="link156"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p156.jpg">156</a></span>been
      sustained. Then he ran to and fro among his fellows, exhorting them to
      bear with courage this terrible reverse, and begging them to meet at once
      in a cave hard by, and consult as to the best measures which could be
      taken under the circumstances in which they found themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a very short time, owing to his exertions, more than a hundred
      of the unhappy mortals assembled together and began to take counsel for
      the future. As is usual in all such cases, there was a great variety of
      opinion. One man advised that they should all forthwith hang themselves,
      as life had become so insecure as to be almost worthless. It was urged,
      however, that this would afford no remedy for the existing state of
      things, and would be like throwing away your gold because you had been
      robbed of your silver. Besides, it would be an undignified thing to come
      to a general termination of so inglorious a character, and the proposal
      was speedily scouted as one totally unworthy of consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was suggested by another person that a subscription should
      immediately be raised for the sufferers, and advertisements to that effect
      be inserted in all the daily papers. As the speaker was the proprietor and
      editor of one of these, it is possible that he had an eye to business in
      making the suggestion, which, however, fell flat upon the ears of the
      audience. No one there had any money to spare, and everybody was more or
      less a sufferer from a calamity which had fallen so generally upon the
      race of man. Some advised that they should all emigrate, but then they
      didn&rsquo;t know where to go to, and, in short, it seemed as if they were
      likely <span class="pagenum"><a name="link157" id="link157"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p157.jpg">157</a></span>to come to no
      agreement; everybody objected to everything that anybody else said, no one
      seemed to have any weight or authority in the assembly, and it really
      appeared a hopeless case altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last Hans, who had kept a respectful silence for some time, as
      became one in his position, whilst others talked nonsense (which is
      occasionally done at public meetings, as well as elsewhere, down to the
      present day), came forward, and asked leave to offer his advice. &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo;
      he said, 'I hope you will agree with me that it is necessary to do
      something in this case. To sit still with our hands folded, and do
      nothing, would be certainly the very worst course we could possibly
      pursue. The horrible cruelty of the vile Daddyroarer has first driven us
      from our former happy homes, destroyed our hopes of prosperity, and
      condemned us to an almost savage life; then, not content with the amount
      of misery which he had already inflicted on us, the tyrant has followed us
      even into the forest, uprooted and ruined the new home which we had formed
      for ourselves, and once more turned adrift upon the wide world those of us
      who have been lucky enough to escape with life. How long then are we to
      endure such a state of things as this? While this huge monster walks the
      earth unchecked and unrestrained, no man&rsquo;s life will be safe; and
      even if we run away and find for ourselves fresh hiding-places, what
      security have we that at any moment he may not appear amongst us and again
      inflict upon us ruin and destruction? Depend upon it, gentlemen, this
      question must be looked in the face. It cannot be evaded any longer.
      Running away is useless. The enemy must be no longer avoided. At this
      moment he sleeps in security over our <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link158" id="link158"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p158.jpg">158</a></span>ruined homes. He
      must be attacked! Never was there a more auspicious moment! Let us take
      courage, and assail the giant where he lies!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Hans spoke a thrill of horror ran through the meeting, who could
      by no means bring themselves to realise the idea of attacking a monster so
      many sizes larger than themselves, and gifted with strength so infinitely
      greater&rdquo; than the united efforts of many &lsquo;of them put
      together. So a murmur of voices, all in the negative, greeted the little
      tailor when he resumed his seat; and presently one of those present, who,
      being the oldest, was reputed the wisest (which, however, is by no means a
      safe rule to go by), stood up and spoke in his turn. He said that it was
      folly to talk after the fashion of the speech to which they had just
      listened; and, as this remark was somewhat personal, it was at once much
      applauded, which encouraged the orator to proceed. He remarked that since
      the first man came into the world down to that day no man had ever-dreamed
      of attacking a giant, and, therefore, that it could not now be done. This
      sentiment also commended itself to many of his hearers, who cherished the
      belief that no new scheme ought ever to be entertained, as the world had
      gone on so far very well without it, and that what had never been done
      before had better not be attempted. Finding his audience possessed with
      such a good conservative spirit, the old man said further, that as giants
      had from time immemorial tyrannized over man, it was doubtless intended
      that they should do so, and it might savour of impiety to endeavour to
      alter a state of things which had lasted so long. Moreover, the power and
      authority of giants over men was so well established <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link159" id="link159"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p159.jpg">159</a></span>that it would be
      almost impossible to reverse the order of things. Comparing such an
      attempt with efforts made in other countries, it seemed to him to be
      almost as absurd as an attempt to reform a House of Lords, or reverse the
      decision of a Governing Body. Then, hazarding a joke (which was very well
      received), he said, that if his friend the little tailor wanted &lsquo;his
      goose cooked,&rsquo; no doubt he could get that operation performed by
      attacking authority, and if he chose to run his head against a wall, no
      one could prevent him. But he (the speaker) would appeal to those before
      him, as sensible and practical men, and ask them to reject as idle and
      absurd the wild theories placed before them by little Hans. Giants would
      be giants, and men would be men to the end of the world, and they must put
      up with the misfortune which had befallen them as well as they could, and
      not make it worse by entering upon such a hopeless enterprise as that
      which had been proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This speech met with so much approval from the mortals there
      assembled, who were thoroughly cowed and subdued in spirit by the long
      course of suffering which they had undergone, that Hans at first felt his
      heart sink within him. He knew well enough that he could do nothing alone,
      and it seemed as if all were against him. But, remembering the old adage,
      that 'Fortune favours the brave,&rsquo; and being a man of undaunted pluck
      and resolution, he determined not to be put down either by taunts or
      claptrap. He therefore rose again, and ignoring, like a wise man, the
      foolish and vulgar joke directed against his own most respectable trade,
      proceeded to state his views to the best of his ability. He acknowledged
      that reverence ought to be paid <span class="pagenum"><a name="link160"
      id="link160"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p160.jpg">160</a></span>to
      age, and that the last speaker was consequently-entitled to every
      attention. At the same time he could not but observe, that if his doctrine
      were to hold good, that things should be left to go on as they are merely
      <i>because</i> they are, and that nothing new ought ever to be attempted
      for fear of failure, the world would be in a very lamentable condition,
      and no improvement would ever take place in anything. He modestly remarked
      that, according to tradition, mankind at one period of their history wore
      only the skins of animals, and at a previous time no clothes at all, and
      that, if the old gentleman&rsquo;s views were correct, they never ought to
      have quitted the latter condition. 'Moreover,&rsquo; said he, to cut a
      long story short, &lsquo;it has been suggested to me that <i>I</i> may
      attack the giant alone if I please, and no one will interfere. Be it so: I
      only ask for six others&mdash;half-a-dozen volunteers&mdash;and sooner
      than submit any longer to the present misery and degradation in which I
      and my fellow-men are placed, I will make the attempt; I can but perish,
      and, in such a cause, death will be glorious.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At these words of the valiant tailor a low murmur of applause ran
      through the audience, who now began to perceive that he was really in
      earnest, and had not spoken at first out of mere bravado. For the honour
      of that oppressed race, I am glad to be able to add, that before any long
      time had elapsed, the six volunteers whom Hans had demanded were
      forthcoming in the persons of that number of sturdy young men, who felt
      that the hour had come when one great effort must be made to set their
      race free from slavery, and were prepared to follow their brave leader in
      his perilous enterprise. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link161"
      id="link161"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p161.jpg">161</a></span>Indeed,
      a number of others offered themselves as soon as the thing was fairly
      started, for man is an imitative animal, and like a flock of sheep, if the
      leader once makes a dash down a lane or up a bank, there are always plenty
      to follow. Hans, however, carefully selected six of his own acquaintance,
      whom he knew to be skilled in certain trades, of which a knowledge would
      be requisite in order to carry out his plans, and upon whom he knew he
      could thoroughly rely. He now looked proudly round upon the other mortals,
      and calling his six friends to follow him, left the place of meeting,
      attended by the good wishes of those whose deliverance he was about to
      attempt,&mdash;not, however, altogether unmixed with sundry depreciatory
      sneers on the part of the old gentleman and his immediate followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without any delay, Hans journeyed back to the spot upon which the
      mighty Bramble-buffer lay fast asleep, his gigantic carcase resting at
      full length upon the ground. Hard by, the little tailor stopped his troop,
      and unfolded to them the plan which his fertile brain had conceived, and
      for the execution of which he depended upon their assistance. This was
      none other than to capture the monster, and either put him to death or
      render him the dependant and slave of those over whom he had so long
      tyrannized. It would of course be no easy task, but, on the contrary, one
      which would require much courage and determination, not to say
      self-sacrifice, as a possibility by no means remote. For, should the giant
      awake during the operations which were contemplated, he would probably
      make short work of Hans and his six followers; and thus, in attempting
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link162" id="link162"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p162.jpg">162</a></span>to achieve the
      freedom of their people, they would emphatically have walked out of the
      frying-pan into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing daunted, however, Hans, speaking in a low tone of voice,
      informed his friends of all that he had planned in his head, and, knowing
      how valuable is example upon all such occasions, he told them that he
      would himself approach the enemy in the first instance, so that if he
      should suddenly awake, none other save the leader of the attack need of
      necessity be lost. The gallant six all expressed their readiness to go
      too, but Hans told them that they must in every respect obey his orders if
      he was to continue their leader, and upon this they yielded the point, and
      graciously consented to remain in comparative safety, whilst the valiant
      tailor advanced upon the foe. This he did very cautiously, and walked
      twice all round the sleeping giant in order to be quite sure that he was
      really fast asleep. This was indeed the case, as he speedily assured
      himself: there was no pretence about the matter; the deep, regular
      breathing of the sleeper, his closed eyes, and the air of repose visible
      in every feature, told their own tale, and Hans felt that no moment could
      be more propitious for his design. Accordingly, he climbed up into the
      branches of a neighbouring tree, and choosing one of them, which appeared
      from its position and size to be suitable to his purpose, swung himself
      lightly down, and alighted upon the giant&rsquo;s chin, close to his
      mouth, to reconnoitre which was his first object and intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a stick in his hand, and in entering the mouth, which was to
      him like some enormous cave, unfortunately touched with it some tender
      place in the skin, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link163" id="link163"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p163.jpg">163</a></span>which caused the
      monster to be seized with a violent desire to sneeze, which he accordingly
      did with an effect hardly anticipated by the luckless Hans, who, stick and
      all (the latter being broken in several&rsquo; pieces), was sent up many
      feet in the air, and fell, more nearly frightened than he had ever been
      before in his life, upon the enormous breast of the creature who had thus
      treated him.

      &ldquo;Most fortunately for the little fellow, giants sleep longer and
      more soundly than any other created beings, and it was not one sneeze that
      could cause old Bramble-buffer to awake from an after-dinner nap. The fall
      of Hans upon his breast was to him no more than would have been the
      dropping of a nut from an overhanging tree, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link164" id="link164"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p164.jpg">164</a></span>and with a kind
      of half-grunt, half-snore, he almost immediately became again completely
      unconscious, and, with his mouth wide open, returned to the land of dreams
      and snored audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, then, was the opportunity for which Hans had earnestly hoped,
      and he beckoned forward his followers, who approached at once, in order to
      perform their part of the tremendous task before them. They were divided
      into two parties, whose occupation was essentially different. Three of
      them employed themselves upon the beard and hair of the sleeping monster.
      They&rsquo; carefully, and with the lightest possible touch, separated
      hair from hair, and then fastening to each single hair a strong rope, as
      far as their ropes would go, bound it down to the ground with pegs or
      nails, or fastened it securely to the branch of some tree near at hand.
      They took every precaution not to wake the creature upon whom they were at
      work, and they performed their business with a skill and quickness which
      showed that Hans had made a good selection in the volunteers whom he had
      accepted. The monster was ere long bound by innumerable ties to the earth,
      and the number and strength of these was momentarily increased. Nor,
      indeed, were the operations of the three men confined to the hairs of the
      head and beard: the old Daddyroarer was a very hairy person, and they
      found upon his legs and arms so many hairs of the thickness of a
      large-sized rope, that by turning their attention to these limbs and to
      other parts of his body, they multiplied many times over the links by
      which they gradually bound him more and more securely to mother earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile the other three volunteers were actively engaged <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link165" id="link165"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p165.jpg">165</a></span>in an occupation
      if possible still more dangerous. It was the mouth of the giant upon which
      Hans had always known he should have to make his great attempt. For should
      every other part of his huge frame be brought under subjection and his
      mouth left free, the direst consequences might be apprehended. His roars
      might bring to his assistance others of his kind from a distance; and even
      if this did not actually occur, the whole population of the country would
      be alarmed, if indeed the volunteers themselves were not deafened and
      rendered senseless by the sound. It was bad enough even when they
      commenced, for the snores of the sleeping giant were like very loud
      thunder, closer to the earth than common, or the roar of many cannons in
      some great conflict of human armies. Luckily, however, he only snored at
      intervals, between which much could be done, and by carefully filling
      their ears with cotton wool, the four men were able to proceed with their
      task, the noise being somewhat deadened by this wise precaution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hans, armed with a long spear sharpened at both ends, boldly
      entered the mouth first. It was as dark as an oven, and almost as hot,
      whilst the odour was far less agreeable, as the monster liked his venison
      high, and had eaten rather an unusual quantity that day. In fact, from
      time to time the men were obliged to creep out, faint and sick, and take a
      whiff of fresh air and a drop of brandy before they could go on with their
      work. Hans carefully placed his long spear in such a position between the
      jaws that they could not possibly be closed upon him. He was obliged to be
      exceedingly careful in climbing round and over the teeth, which were of
      such size, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link166" id="link166"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p166.jpg">166</a></span>length, and
      sharpness, that to traverse them was like climbing over a wall with
      enormously long pointed iron spikes at the top of it. In fact, but for the
      circumstance of the existence of various holes and crevices through which
      he could creep, Hans would have found his task even more difficult than
      was actually the case.

      &ldquo;His three companions, meanwhile, had provided themselves with a
      great quantity of beams, joists, rafters, and all other necessary articles
      for the purpose which they intended to accomplish. They set to work with
      great zeal to fortify the giant&rsquo;s mouth after a novel fashion,
      fixing strong beams of oak between the teeth, and building in planks of
      oak and fir so as to create a fixed and strong roof within the mouth which
      no power could remove save in the same manner by which it had been <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link167" id="link167"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p167.jpg">167</a></span>erected, namely,
      by carpenters&rsquo; work performed by skilful operators. As the darkness
      of the interior of the mouth rendered it difficult to work therein, the
      workmen, who became bolder after they had worked for some time without
      interruption, fetched a lantern, which Hans carefully hung from one of the
      beams, and, by the assistance of its light, the work proceeded more
      rapidly; and after a time the four men arrived at the conclusion that
      there was little more to do in order to secure the object for which they
      had undertaken their hazardous task.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Accordingly they all left the mouth, except their valiant leader,
      who now struck a severe blow upon the tongue of the giant with a fragment
      of beam, in order to awake and summon him to surrender. Such, however, was
      the thickness of the monster&rsquo;s skin, that even upon this most
      sensitive part a second and harder blow was necessary before the desired
      effect could be produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having <span class="pagenum"><a name="link168" id="link168"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p168.jpg">168</a></span>dealt this with
      all his force, Hans went forth and stood upon the protruding lip of the
      giant, whence lie was presently hurled down once more upon his breast, as
      the huge frame trembled and, with a sigh, the monster awoke. Hans was
      speedily upon his legs again, climbed at once boldly through the beard and
      whiskers of his prostrate enemy, and standing upon the lower part of his
      cheek, and elevating his lantern, shouted at the top of his voice, &lsquo;You
      vile old murdering Daddy-roarer! surrender yourself as my prisoner.
      Villain, you shall now pay dearly for all the mischief you have done, and
      the innocent lives which you have sacrificed. Monster, you must die!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Bramble-buffer, half asleep and half awake, at first made no
      response whatever to this appeal, which, in fact, he scarcely heard.
      Neither could he see the individual by whom he was addressed; all he heard
      was a noise as of a shrill penny trumpet close to his ear, and it was some
      few seconds before he recovered his senses sufficiently to make out what
      was said to him. All he saw was the feeble ray of a lantern, and he waited
      for awhile in hopeless confusion. Then, at last, he perceived the strange
      little figure which had addressed him in so haughty a tone, and for an
      instant a feeling of contemptuous mirth took possession of his soul. This,
      however, did not last long, for Hans spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t believe you are captive, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
      he cried. &lsquo;Just try to move, you old beggar, will you, and you&rsquo;ll
      soon know the rights of it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bramble-buffer, on hearing these words, immediately followed the
      advice which they gave, but found that he was so firmly secured to the
      ground by more than <span class="pagenum"><a name="link169" id="link169"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p169.jpg">169</a></span>half the hairs
      of his head and body, that he could not move an inch. Then he tried to
      roar, or at all events to speak to his vanquisher, and discover what it
      all meant, but found himself totally unable to do so. His mouth was so
      carefully and solidly fortified, that he could no more close it than fly,
      and he found that he was completely and absolutely in the power of those
      who had taken advantage of his sleep to make him a helpless captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as he saw that the giant was aware of his condition, Hans
      carefully kicked him on the nostril, and went on to say, &lsquo;Now, you
      old rascal, you will have time to repent, perhaps, but no more. The crows
      and ravens will soon come and pick out your eyes, and the wolves and other
      animals for whom the flesh of an old giant is not too strong, will
      doubtless make an end of you before long. If, however, these should not
      arrive soon, you may starve here as comfortably as you can, and die of
      hunger at your leisure.&rsquo; With these words the little tailor stamped
      violently on the old Daddy-roarer&rsquo;s cheek, and laughed scornfully as
      he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly helpless, overcome with sorrow at his miserable
      condition, and struck with horror at the melancholy and wretched fate
      which he saw impending, Bramble-buffer could bear up no longer, but burst
      into tears, in doing which he very nearly destroyed his conqueror, who
      would certainly have been washed away by the stream which suddenly came
      gushing down the cheek on which he was standing, had he not with his
      wonted agility jumped on one side, and swung himself off by the whiskers
      on to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing his enemy thus completely prostrate in body and <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link170" id="link170"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p170.jpg">170</a></span>soul, and
      evidently perfectly conscious of the helplessness of his position, the
      acute brain of Hans began immediately to consider whether there might not
      be some better way of turning the giant to account than by either killing
      him or leaving him to die, especially as there would be considerable
      practical inconvenience in getting rid of so huge a carcase, which would
      moreover attract all the wolves, foxes, vultures, crows, and other
      disagreeable animals from far and near, and render the place unbearable
      for months to come. A happy thought struck him, and he instantly struck
      the giant in consequence, climbing back again on to his lip in order to do
      so. &lsquo;Listen to me, Daddy roarer!&rsquo; he cried at the top of his
      voice. &lsquo;You can purchase your life if you wish it. What do you say
      to that?&rsquo;

      &ldquo;Fastened as he was, and unable to speak or move his mouth, the old
      fellow could only signify his delight by <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link171" id="link171"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p171.jpg">171</a></span>winking his
      eyes, which he forthwith did with as much expression as could be expected
      from a person of his intellectual capacity. Hans perfectly understood that
      an affirmative reply was intended, and he thus proceeded to explain his
      meaning to the giant. &lsquo;Now, look here, old chap! you must confess
      that you have been a regular ruffian: destroying crops, throwing down
      houses, bagging sheep and cattle, stamping upon people who never did <i>you</i>
      any harm, and generally playing Old Harry with the whole country. Now, if
      I and my mates let you off this time, and spare your life, you must vow,
      promise, and solemnly declare that you will do just exactly the reverse
      and opposite of all you have hitherto done. You must watch over the
      interests of mankind, and, in fact, you must be our slave, perform the
      tasks which we shall impose upon you, and yield a ready and implicit
      obedience to all commands which shall be laid upon you by properly
      constituted authorities among mankind, from the Emperor of Germany down to
      the parish constable. If you&rsquo;re game for this, old fellow, wink your
      eye again, and it&rsquo;s a bargain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may perhaps be objected to our hero Hans, Brother Thames, that
      his language was somewhat of what is termed a &lsquo;slang&rsquo;
      character; but if critics make, as critics will, such remarks, they should
      remember that, in the days of which I am speaking, tailors were not, as
      now, upon an equality with educated gentlemen, and their language was not
      unnaturally somewhat less polished and refined than might otherwise have
      been the case. I should willingly put into the mouth of Hans expressions
      of a nature better calculated to please the superlatively well-conditioned
      gentlemen who, in these days <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link172" id="link172"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p172.jpg">172</a></span>when all men are
      equal, speak with acknowledged accuracy of taste and grammar, whether they
      chance to have been half, wholly, or not at all educated, and cannot
      endure in the mouths of others anything which falls short of their own
      high standard; but I speak of things and people as they really were in
      those old days, and I cannot alter the truth for anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hans was only a tailor, and perhaps a little vulgar into the
      bargain, and he certainly accosted the old giant with more slang
      expressions and less respect than his age and rank might have entitled him
      to expect. So it was, however, and, what is more, the result was the same
      as it would probably have been if Hans had used other and better language
      to express his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Bramble-buffer no sooner heard the conditions imposed than he
      winked his eye again without the smallest hesitation, in order to signify
      that he agreed to the bargain. Upon this our friend Hans immediately
      summoned his companions, who came at once, and, being ordered by him to do
      so, climbed upon the face of the still-prostrate foe, and, at Hans&rsquo;
      further commands, took up the positions which he indicated. Three of them
      sat quietly upon his forehead, whilst two others sat, one over each of his
      eyes, holding in their hands a sharp dagger which they kept suspended just
      above his eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now, old boy,&rsquo; shouted Hans again, right into the ear
      of the giant, 'look here; I am going to keep my part of the bargain, and
      begin to set you free. If, when your mouth is open, you cry out for help,
      or say or do anything unpleasant, straight into your eyes go these two
      daggers, and you will find that you will fare much <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link173" id="link173"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p173.jpg">173</a></span>worse than if
      you had kept your word. As soon as your voice is free, you will swear the
      Big Oath of the giants to be the slave of our people henceforth; and you
      shall then be set free from the other bonds by which you are now
      constrained.&rsquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Having said these words, Hans boldly descended once more into the
      huge mouth of his former enemy, accompanied by his remaining companions,
      who carried a lantern. Then, taking up his spear, which he had removed
      from its position in the giant&rsquo;s jaws as soon as the beams and
      rafters had been all fixed and securely built in, he carefully moved one
      of these, which was the key <span class="pagenum"><a name="link174"
      id="link174"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p174.jpg">174</a></span>to
      the whole edifice, and then, jumping out of the mouth, told the owner
      thereof that he could do the rest himself. This, indeed, was the case, for
      with a vigorous crunch of his jaws, Bramble-buffer now smashed beams,
      rafters, joists, and planks all into one shapeless mass, which he
      forthwith spat out of his mouth as fast as he could, and afterwards
      indulged in a long, deep sigh of relief. It was a moment of agonizing
      suspense to the men. Suppose the giant should play false? They might
      indeed put out his eyes, but his roars would probably bring other giants
      to his aid before long, and, when free, his vengeance would be terrible. A
      very few seconds, however, put an end to their doubts, and dissipated all
      their fears. The race of giants are a curious combination of good and
      evil, and if the latter generally predominates, it is really not so much
      from natural or inherent vice as from defective education, there being a
      sad want of elementary schools among giants, and few people big enough to
      undertake the instruction of their youth. But no well-born giant of
      average respectability breaks the great giant oath, and this was what
      Bramble-buffer had promised to take. Nor was he false to his promise: as
      soon as he had recovered his powers of speech, his very first words were
      as follows, pronounced in rhyme, doubtless for the sake of emphasis:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
'By the mountains of the earth;
By the ground which gave me birth;
By the streams which here do flow;
By the cots I&rsquo;ve oft laid low;

By the woods and forests great;
By the woven web of Fate;
By the waters of the Rhine,
Swear I now this oath of mine:&mdash;

War with man henceforth t&rsquo; eschew,
To their cause for e&rsquo;er be true,
All their mandates to obey,
Willing slave by night or day,

To their will submissive bow,
Since they grant my freedom now!&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <span class="pagenum"><a name="link175" id="link175"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p175.jpg">175</a></span>is but doing
      justice to the estimation in which the character of the giants as
      vow-keepers stood, to say that from the moment that old Bramble-buffer
      pronounced these words, not one of the seven heroes who stood on and about
      his face at the time of his dozing had the smallest fear for themselves,
      or for those to whom he had just vowed obedience. They felt, on the
      contrary, such entire confidence in the moral probity of their old enemy,
      and in his honest intention to observe his oath in the most religious
      manner, that they immediately threw down their daggers (in such a reckless
      manner as might have proved serious to the face of the old giant if they
      had not fortunately fallen in his whiskers), and proceeded without delay
      to climb down and set free the hairs which they had so securely fastened
      with cords and ropes. Little by little they separated those disagreeable
      knots and ties, and the emancipated Bramble-buffer at last rose once more
      from the ground a free giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as he was upon his legs, the first thing he did was to
      shake himself violently, and in so doing cause the earth to tremble
      beneath him as from the shock of an earthquake. He then spoke humbly to
      Hans, and asked his will; but as in doing this he employed his ordinary
      voice, which was not unlike thunder, his conqueror made the first use of
      his power by desiring his slave to speak in a whisper for the future,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link176" id="link176"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p176.jpg">176</a></span>unless he should
      happen to be standing at a great distance from the person addressed. He
      next directed the captive Bramble-buffer to carry him and his companions
      to the cave in which they had left the rest of the mortals. This cave was
      formed out of rocks, close to the vast ruins of an ancient castle, which
      at some distant time had been built in a very strong position, but which
      age or giants had long ago partially demolished. In front of the cave huge
      rocks jutted out on all sides, and on a plateau of rock there came out
      several of the mortals to receive Hans and his prisoner, as soon as the
      news had spread that they were near at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bramble-buffer had meekly obeyed the commands of his master, and
      brought him and his six volunteers safely to the place they desired. Then
      Hans, having directed that he should be placed upon a table of rock just
      opposite that on which the other mortals were standing, and which was
      about on a level with the giant&rsquo;s head as he stood below, introduced
      their new slave to his fellow-men, and related to them the perils and
      adventures through which he and his six friends had passed, and the
      successful issue to which they had brought the affair which had been
      entrusted to them. Upon this the men all set up a shout of joy, as they
      gazed with unfeigned delight upon their old enemy, humbled and brought low
      as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there followed the usual course of action in such matters.
      Everybody praised Hans, and everybody pretended that <i>they</i> had known
      his talents, skill, and bravery from the first, and had always been in
      favour of the expedition which he had planned and executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One <span class="pagenum"><a name="link177" id="link177"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p177.jpg">177</a></span>would have
      thought that the old gentleman, at least, would have remained silent, but
      this was far from being the case. On the contrary, he was foremost in
      offering his congratulations to the triumphant Hans, and even went so far
      as to say that he could not help taking some credit to himself in the
      matter, for that, highly approving of his scheme from the first moment he
      heard it, and being most anxious for its success, he had known that a
      little pretended opposition was the only way to get up a feeling in favour
      of it among the general throng, and had therefore spoken doubtfully in
      order to secure this result. His wisdom, he added, had been amply
      justified; Hans had succeeded as he, the old gentleman, had always known
      he must and would succeed, and he hoped he would ever be grateful to those
      whose age and experience had assisted him at the first beginning of the
      affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hans listened with respectful attention to this speech, and to many
      of a similar character from that large class of persons who always tell
      one after an event has happened that they perfectly well knew it would
      occur, and had often prophesied it beforehand. He did not deem it
      necessary to make any answer, but accepted all the compliments offered him
      with becoming modesty, and told his friends plainly that he had acted for
      the general benefit, and was very thankful that success had crowned his
      efforts. Many rewards were, of course, bestowed upon the hero: he was made
      a knight of several orders, which conferred the right to wear certain
      stars and crosses at court, which was accounted a great privilege in those
      days, and was all the more valued because it was always so uncertain to
      whom <span class="pagenum"><a name="link178" id="link178"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p178.jpg">178</a></span>it would be
      given, some persons who had done nothing to deserve it being frequently
      thus decorated, while others were left out who had fairly earned it by
      service rendered to the public. But everybody rejoiced in the honours
      showered upon Sir Hans, and tailoring immediately grew fashionable and has
      so continued ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From that time forth there is but little of interest to relate to
      you concerning the giant Bramble-buffer. He honestly and diligently
      performed his duty to his masters, making and altering mountains for them
      when required, holding a gigantic umbrella over particular crops which the
      rain would have damaged when a storm happened to break over them, and
      performing very many other offices for the performance of which brute
      strength was required. In short, he proved a most faithful, useful, and
      obedient servant, never grumbled at being required to rise early,
      complained of his victuals, or said that, &lsquo;it wasn&rsquo;t his place&rsquo;
      to do any particular service asked of him, but did his duty like a true
      and good giant, and was consequently happy and contented during the whole
      of his remaining life. I cannot tell you precisely when that life
      terminated, but I rather fancy his head got confused when two great
      nations took to quarrelling as to which of them had the best claim to my
      river, and consequently to the giant who served the population of the
      country near, and if this absurdity on the part of mortals turned with
      them into madness, it is not a matter of surprise that the same disease
      fell upon the less powerful intellect of the poor giant, and that he put
      an end to himself when, like the nations themselves, he was labouring
      under 'temporary insanity.&rsquo; At all events, I have told you his
      legend as <span class="pagenum"><a name="link179" id="link179"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p179.jpg">179</a></span>far as it has
      been well authenticated, and will now leave you to pass your opinion
      thereupon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good tale, indeed, Brother Rhine,&rdquo; remarked Father Thames
      at the conclusion of this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you approve of it,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Have
      you never had giants of this kind in your own country, Brother Thames?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus addressed, the old king pondered for awhile, and then made answer as
      follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, we have had giants, of one sort or another, in
      old England, but rarely of the size, and scarce even of the mischievous
      character, of your Daddyroarers. But since you have told me a tale of the
      giant, let me give you a legend of the small people;&rdquo; and so saying

    <h2>
      THE MANNIKINS&rsquo; CASTLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> don&rsquo;t
      pretend, Brother Rhine, to have as many haunted castles upon my banks as
      you have on and about the sides of your famous river. I have always denied
      that the chief merit of a castle consists in its being haunted, and the
      simple-minded people who inhabit this old England of ours look to the
      circumstance of their houses being comfortable to live in, free from
      draughts and bad smells, large enough to entertain their friends, and
      possessed of good kitchen arrangements, rather than to their being the
      residence of any supernatural beings such as those of which you and your
      castles appear to be so proud. Moreover I have often observed that the
      presence of such creatures is constantly connected with the commission of
      some frightful <span class="pagenum"><a name="link180"
      id="link180"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p180.jpg">180</a></span>crime
      at a distant period of time, the perpetrator of which appears desirous to
      perpetuate its memory by haunting the place where it was performed as much
      as he or she conveniently can. We islanders, on the contrary, when any of
      us happen to commit a crime, prefer that it should be forgotten as soon as
      possible, and think it very indecent and improper of any member of a
      respectable family who may have distinguished himself in the paths of vice
      if he seeks to keep up the remembrance thereof, and throw a stain upon the
      escutcheon of his house by coming back again to earth after he has once
      left it for the benefit of the survivors. There are exceptions, of course,
      to this rule, but I state what I believe to be the popular feeling here
      upon the subject; and although I am going to tell you a story which
      concerns a castle, and also beings not strictly mortal or ordinary, I may
      at once tell you that, so far as I know, no murder was ever committed
      there, and no ghost or demon of an unpleasant character ever entered the
      place, except under the casual circumstances which I shall presently
      relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an old castle, however; a very old castle, built much more
      massively than the structures of modern times, and full of curious old
      bits of wall, over which antiquaries would puzzle nowadays to determine
      their date, and having here and there wonderful windows with huge stone
      mullions set into the great, deep walls, and apparently built with the
      intention of lasting until the end of the world. In the chief window of
      this old ruin&mdash;for a ruin it was at the time of my story&mdash;there
      habitually sat a large black owl, who was generally supposed to be the
      lord and ruler of the place.

      Perhaps <i>he</i> was a spirit if one only knew it, but as no one <i>did</i>
      know <span class="pagenum"><a name="link182" id="link182"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p182.jpg">182</a></span>it, it never
      entered anybody&rsquo;s head to say so. He was hardly mortal though, for
      he not only hooted like an ordinary owl, but spoke like a Christian; at
      least so I suppose, or how would he have made himself understood by other
      beings who were <i>not</i> owls, and who yet had to communicate with him?
      For beings more extraordinary than owls inhabited the old castle. A large
      number of mannikins had taken possession of it some years after its
      abandonment by mortals, and here the merry little creatures would sport
      and gambol all the livelong day. They used to clamber about the strong
      ivy-trees that grew up the sides of the old walls, playing at hide and
      seek among the thick leaves, and making the place re-echo with their
      joyous shouts. They were wont to sport and play with the large lizards
      which basked upon the walls when the sun came out with rays bright and
      strong, and warm enough to tempt them to do so, and they would scamper up
      and down the whole place, trying their skill in ascending and descending
      the steepest and most perpendicular places in the old walls, where the
      stone was crumbling away from sheer age, and where no being of mortal
      frame and mould could have found a secure footing for a moment. Oh, they
      were merry little chaps, those mannikins!
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the precincts of the castle itself, in the ancient courtyards which
      once reverberated with the shrill blast of trumpets calling men forth to
      war; where men-at-arms formerly strode boldly along, filled with warlike
      ardour, and where martial sounds rang out loud and oft in the days of old,
      grass was now growing long and rank, which was trodden under foot only by
      the lively mannikins in their daily and nightly dances, whilst their
      shrill and merry cries replaced those sterner sounds which had long <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link183" id="link183"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p183.jpg">183</a></span>since ceased,
      and those who had caused them had passed for ever from mortal ken and
      mortal vision. All was indeed changed; but I am not prepared to say that
      the change was not for the better, for I was never fond of the old feudal
      times myself; and the barons who used to possess such castles, and send
      forth their retainers to fight, were much more troublesome people to the
      world at large, and their neighbours in particular, than were the little
      mannikins who played around the old place, or the wise old owl who blinked
      his eyes cosily and comfortably in the stone window.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would have thought that such innocent creatures as owls and mannikins
      could have had no enemies, but must have been on good terms with all their
      fellow-creatures of every description. True, they sometimes made
      themselves disagreeable in the way of taking new-laid eggs from farmyards
      which were within temptingly easy reach of their own abode, and now and
      then they were shrewdly suspected of having milked a cow with which they
      had no business, and stolen cream when the dairymaid had been careless
      enough to leave the dairy-door unlocked. In these particulars, though,
      they were, after all, no worse than mortals have frequently been, and in
      fact not half so bad, inasmuch as they made what return they could to the
      country people who might have now and then suffered from their
      depredations, sometimes going out in the moonlight nights and making their
      hay for them or finishing the cutting of a cornfield, and even
      condescending so far, on more than one occasion, as to sweep a chimney and
      thoroughly dust a kitchen floor. For they were very active little fellows,
      those mannikins, and could turn their hands to almost anything if they saw
      fit to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      They <span class="pagenum"><a name="link184" id="link184"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p184.jpg">184</a></span>had some enemies
      no doubt, in wild and evil-disposed animals, for they loved to warn the
      lamb when the wolf was lying in wait for him, and often saved the poultry
      by a timely notice that the fox was coming, whereby they incurred the
      wrath and hatred of these midnight marauders. But the chief and principal
      of their enemies were the witches, who have during all ages been a plague
      to this otherwise favoured land. I say advisedly, in all ages, because
      this is indeed the truth, although in their form and shape, as well as in
      their method of doing mischief, persons of this class have wonderfully
      changed. In old times they were generally of repulsive appearance,
      oftentimes clad in a red cloak, generally with a stick in one hand, and
      almost invariably humpbacked or misshapen in some way, and attended by a
      familiar in the shape of a cat. They were consulted only on serious
      affairs, or when somebody wanted to be revenged upon somebody else; they
      were malicious in their words and actions; hated everything good,
      respectable, and handsome; and, if possible, transformed it as soon as
      they could into something quite the reverse. Nowadays, our English witches
      are entirely different: their shape is usually beautiful, their figure
      perfect, their eyes bright and full of expression, and their dress made in
      admirable good taste and after an exceedingly becoming fashion. They have
      no familiar spirit, and the best of them allow no one to be too familiar
      with them; neither do they change the form and shape of mankind into those
      of hideous creatures, but, on the contrary, rather prefer that men should
      be handsome and well shaped; but they still exercise over them an almost
      resistless sway, which, however, is far more <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link185" id="link185"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p185.jpg">185</a></span>willingly obeyed
      than was the power of the witches of the old times; and they are now
      consulted, not so much on matters of hate and revenge, as on those which
      concern feelings far more desirable to be cherished in the human breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the witches of whom I have to speak to-day hated the mannikins as much
      as a certain person is said to hate holy water. The reason of this was
      sufficiently obvious, and arose from the entire and radical difference
      between the views of the two sets of beings. The mannikins were, as I have
      said, although mischievous, the friends of mankind; the witches were the
      enemies of everything human which was not as wicked as themselves: the
      mannikins found pleasure in the most innocent amusements; the witches had
      no satisfaction in anything which did not injure or give pain to somebody
      else: the mannikins were gay and cheerful, the witches dull and morose,
      save when under the influence of strong drink: the mannikins generally ran
      about on their own legs; the witches habitually rode broomsticks, or
      toads, or whatever else came in their way and could be made to serve as a
      horse&mdash;in fine, the mannikins and witches did not, could not, and
      were never likely to, agree upon any one point or in any one feature of
      resemblance, and therefore it was not unnatural that they should be
      animated by feelings of hostility the one against the other. I am bound to
      say, however, that the mannikins never wished to interfere with or annoy
      the witches, and would have been well content to keep out of their way
      altogether if they could only have managed to do so. It was the witches
      who went out of their way to tease and bully the mannikins whenever they
      could, and who were <span class="pagenum"><a name="link186" id="link186"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p186.jpg">186</a></span>entirely
      responsible for all the troubles which occurred in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far from the owl&rsquo;s castle was a large forest, in which all kinds
      of creatures dwelt, and of which the little people from the castle made
      great and frequent use. They dearly loved to wander amongst the enormous
      trees, climbing over their branches, and playing around their gigantic
      trunks. One tree in particular there was which they held very precious. It
      had fallen down, and lay in the forest, covering a prodigious space of
      ground. On, under, and around it, wherever they could do so, the little
      mannikins planted a large number of fungi, under which they sought shelter
      from the rays of the sun or the pelting of the storm, and which they
      called their summer palace. Here they would spend hour after hour when the
      weather was favourable, and I have often wandered up from my river to have
      a sly peep at the merry little creatures sporting and playing whilst the
      distant moon shone upon them from afar, lighting up the walls of the old
      castle in the distance, and bathing with a flood of light the forest and
      fallen tree and the mannikins&rsquo; playground around the latter. There
      they would be, sure enough, night after night, running one after the other
      round the tree and under the fungi, having sometimes coaxed a butterfly or
      two, a big blue-bottle fly, or some other lively insect, to sit up with
      them and make a night of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One would have thought that it would have been scarcely worth the witches&rsquo;
      while to have troubled themselves with these harmless people, when there
      was so much more mischief of a practical character to be done in the world
      without. But there is no accounting for tastes, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link187" id="link187"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p187.jpg">187</a></span>and when the
      evil passion of malice once seizes upon any one, whether mortal or witch,
      no one can tell to what extremities it will lead. Accordingly, several of
      the most notorious witches in that part of the country (and ever since
      England was a country, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire have been the
      favourite abodes of witches) resolved to harass and worry the mannikins by
      every means within their power.

      Mother Wandle frequently assumed the shape of a large bat, under which
      disguise she flitted about all over the country; whilst Goody Tickleback,
      who resided not far from the playing-fields at Eton, habitually rode the
      carcase of a fearful antediluvian monster whose skeleton she had found in
      some queer place, and which, animated by her particular evil spirit, made
      her a capital horse, and struck terror <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link189" id="link189"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p189.jpg">189</a></span>into the souls
      of all those who were unfortunate enough to see it. These foul creatures,
      having secured the aid of others as bad as themselves, determined to root
      out the family of mannikins if they possibly could, or at all events drive
      them once for all from the castle and its neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      They first endeavoured to obtain as allies the nymphs who frequented my
      banks, coming down oftentimes to bathe from their homes in the shady
      recesses of Windsor Forest, where their dances were most beautiful to
      behold, showing off their graceful figures to perfection, and making me
      anxious that they should become permanent residents within the waters of
      my river. These ladies, however, would have nothing to say to the witches,
      whom they declared to be frightful as well as disreputable people, not fit
      for the society of well-conducted females who had any respect for
      themselves. They stated, moreover, that, in their opinion, the mannikins
      had done nothing for which they deserved to be punished, but were
      inoffensive and gentlemanlike little people, who ought rather to be
      encouraged than the reverse. Then the witches tried to cajole my elves,
      and to persuade them to splash, duck, and, if possible, drown their
      enemies when they came down to play upon the river banks. But the elves
      were exceedingly indignant at the request, remarking that the witches had
      nothing whatever to do with <i>them</i>, whilst the mannikins were their
      first cousins once removed, and that &ldquo;blood was thicker than water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as they could get no other allies, the old hags were obliged to
      content themselves with the snakes and bats, the inferior class of toads,
      rats, hedgehogs, and other <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link190" id="link190"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p190.jpg">190</a></span>low-lived and
      despicable animals. And, first of all, they determined to try and get rid
      of the old owl, who was the guardian and protector of the mannikins, and
      the extent of whose power was very little known. So they began by
      spreading all kinds of false and wicked reports about the worthy bird.
      They caused it to be said that he had been seen carrying off young
      chickens, that he had been detected in robbing several pheasants&rsquo;
      nests, and that his private life was no better than it should be.
      Unfortunately, however, for the success of this scheme, the owl took no
      newspapers and saw no company. Consequently, he never heard or read of the
      reports in question, and therefore of course never took the trouble to
      contradict them. The result was that, as is usually the case under similar
      circumstances, people, seeing that the individual attacked took no notice
      of what was said, thought they had better take the same course, and the
      reports dropped gradually out of circulation, until no one believed them
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thus made evident to the witches that they must resort to more
      active measures if they desired to disturb the owl. So they poisoned a
      young rabbit, and put it near the window in which the ancient bird
      commonly sat. But the owl was too many for them. A fox came and looked at
      the rabbit, but having done so, although its appearance was tender and
      tempting, he winked his eye and passed on. Then the owl slowly raised his
      claws to his beak, chuckled a little in a sepulchral tone, and told a
      couple of mannikins to bury that carcass out of the way, and watch any one
      who came and brought such an article again, and, if possible, bring them
      to his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <span class="pagenum"><a name="link191" id="link191"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p191.jpg">191</a></span>was plain that
      the owl was not to be caught asleep, and the witches must betake
      themselves to some new plan. So they sent for some hawks, and persuaded
      them that the owl was the natural and terrible enemy of their race, and
      that by a combined attack upon him, they might get rid of him at once and
      for ever. The hawks went to take a look at the bird and the place, and,
      after a careful inspection, came to the conclusion that there was nothing
      to be gained by attacking either. Their eyes were so sharp, that they saw
      through the plan of the witches, and were perfectly certain that they had
      some end of their own in view. So they told the old ladies that they had
      been entirely mistaken in the matter, that the owl was by no means a bad
      sort of person, and that they could not interfere in any way in the
      private quarrels of other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disappointed at this, the three witches next went to the jays, and easily
      succeeded in inducing these mischievous birds to make such a frightful and
      discordant screaming around the owl&rsquo;s abode as would, in all
      probability, oblige him to leave it. But the owl did no such thing. He
      simply told the mannikins to tell the jays that unless their noise
      instantly ceased, and was not again renewed, a birdsnesting party should
      be organized by the little people as soon as ever the nesting season
      should arrive, and that every jay in or near the wood should have to
      deplore the loss of eggs and young. This was most alarming news to the
      jays, who knew pretty well that the owl had full power to carry out his
      threat, and that if he did so, the mannikins, who had eyes like needles,
      and could climb with so much ease and agility, would certainly take every
      jay&rsquo;s egg in the place, and thus <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link192" id="link192"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p192.jpg">192</a></span>wreak a fearful
      vengeance on the disturbers of their monarch&rsquo;s rest. So the birds
      desisted forthwith from their noise, and observed that they had only done
      it for a &ldquo;lark,&rdquo; and meant no harm; to which the wise bird
      replied, that there was a great difference between an owl and a lark,
      which difference they had better fully recognise before troubling him
      again in such a manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the witches would not desist from their attempt to obtain, by secret
      cunning, the result which they feared to seek by open attack. They hired
      bats to flit around the castle walls by night, with the intention of
      pulling out the owl&rsquo;s tail and wing-feathers, and thus crippling him
      in his sleep, when he might be attacked with less fear of evil
      consequences to the aggressors. The attempt, however, miserably failed.
      The worthy bats, who really belonged to the castle, had experienced such
      great and unvarying kindness from the owl, that they had neither reason
      nor desire to prove faithless to him. They easily and immediately detected
      the strange birds who entered the precincts of the castle, and, having
      forced them to declare the object of their intrusion, drove them out with
      blows and insults, so that they retired in the utmost confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the witches began to see that the owl was not to be outwitted by
      cunning, or destroyed by fraud. War, open war, was the only resource left;
      and the next question would be how it could be carried on with the best
      chance of success. They had the impudence to send a deputation of little
      witchlings to me, calmly asking me to overflow and put the castle and its
      grounds under water, so that it might become too damp for the mannikins to
      dwell in any longer. This, however, I naturally <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link193" id="link193"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p193.jpg">193</a></span>refused to do,
      having much better use to make of the waters of my river than to employ
      them upon any such purpose to suit the pleasure of such low and wicked
      creatures, and, moreover, I told them that, if they dared to come to me
      any more with such base proposals, I would drown half-a-dozen of them by
      way of teaching them manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      They retired somewhat discomfited; but, knowing that I was too
      good-natured to do them any injury as long as they left me quiet, very
      soon came down to my banks again, and entered into successful negotiations
      with a large number of water-rats. These creatures they hired, with a
      bribe of moorhens&rsquo; eggs, which they took from the poor birds in a
      cruel and reckless manner, to join with a number of land-rats in an attack
      upon the castle. The rat-contingent was to unite on the banks of the
      river, and thence to advance upon the castle through that part of the wood
      which lay nearest the stream. They were to be supported by a strong
      auxiliary force of frogs and toads of the worst character, and a body of
      snakes would simultaneously creep upon the doomed place from the other
      side. A number of bats, hooded crows, night-hawks, and such evil birds and
      beasts as they could obtain for the service, would constitute the reserve,
      which the three witches themselves would command in person. The plan was
      that the castle should be invested on all sides at once by the noxious
      reptiles and animals which constituted the witches&rsquo; army, and that a
      bold, and it was hoped decisive, effort should be made to destroy the
      whole race of mannikins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some difficulty was experienced from the fact of the frogs, toads, and
      rats objecting to fight side by side with the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link194" id="link194"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p194.jpg">194</a></span>snakes, who were
      not averse to them as food, and might perhaps remember their natural
      instincts if overtaken by hunger in the hour of battle. The witches had
      foreseen this probable objection on the part of the weaker animals, and
      took measures to remove it without delay. Each of them was made to pass
      before the great witch, Goody Tickleback, who dropped upon the body of
      every one a single drop of magic fluid of extraordinary virtue, which was
      warranted to prevent the creature so touched from being eaten by any
      other. As she performed this strange process, she pronounced these words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;This wondrous sign of magic art
From hurting thee each snake shall stop
For forty hours. If out of heart,
Come back and take another drop.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This went on until the whole of that part of the army which had
      entertained fears, founded upon the habits and natures of those with whom
      they were about to serve as comrades, had passed before the witch, and
      been treated in the manner which I have described.
    </p>
    <p>
      All now seemed ready, and at the appointed time the attacking force moved
      forward in the order which had been previously arranged. It was a lovely
      evening; not a breath was stirring in the sky above, the moon was shining
      clearly, and everything was calm and peaceful, save the hearts of the
      wicked creatures who were plotting and endeavouring to accomplish the
      utter ruin and destruction of the innocent mannikins. They, meanwhile,
      would very likely have been taken by surprise if they had been left to
      their own unassisted strength. Such was the simplicity of their nature,
      that they suspected <span class="pagenum"><a name="link195" id="link195"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p195.jpg">195</a></span>no evil, even
      when preparations against them were being made so actively and openly that
      they might easily have guessed that mischief was brewing. Nevertheless,
      they paid no attention whatever to what was going on, but played about
      just the same as usual until the enemy had matured his plans and was
      almost ready for action. Then, indeed, they were roused by the wise and
      powerful protector whose authority they acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owl summoned them from their sports upon the very day for which the
      witches had appointed the assault upon the castle, and informed them that
      they must prepare to defend themselves against an enemy who was about to
      attack them. He gave minute instructions as to what was to be done, and
      how the castle was to be saved, if possible, from its enemies; and pointed
      out to his subjects that upon the result of the combat their happiness for
      the future, nay, their very lives, depended. Should the witches be
      successful, the mannikins would be either killed or driven away, unless,
      indeed, they suffered the still worse fate of being taken prisoners, in
      which case they would probably be transformed into ugly and loathsome
      creatures by their victorious enemies, whom they would have to serve in
      abject and miserable slavery for the remainder of their existence. It
      therefore behoved them to be up and stirring, in order to save themselves
      and their friends from so cruel a fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little people required no further words in order to awaken their
      martial enthusiasm: they had already suffered enough from the cruel and
      unprovoked enmity of the witches, and this daring attempt to destroy their
      beloved <span class="pagenum"><a name="link196" id="link196"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p196.jpg">196</a></span>home and
      themselves was enough to excite the spirit of the quietest and most
      peaceable mannikin. So without delay they began their preparations for
      resistance to the coming attack, and implicitly obeyed the directions of
      their monarch in each and every particular. They were hurrying to and fro
      all the day, but by nightfall all was ready, and the inhabitants of the
      castle awaited with calmness and confidence the approach of the hostile
      army.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wood around the castle seemed alive that night. The eyes of the
      numerous creeping animals glittered like fireballs as they crawled through
      the leaves, and the rustling of the bats&rsquo; wings sounded like the
      wind among the trees as they hastened forward. On all sides the castle was
      surrounded by its enemies, and the witches gave the signal for an
      immediate assault. With marvellous rapidity the snakes glided in at every
      hole and crevice of the old walls; the rats scampered up them in every
      direction, squeaking violently; whilst the hoarse croaking of the frogs,
      mingled with the spitting of the toads, sounded fearfully through the
      forest in the stillness of that summer&rsquo;s night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attacking party found their first obstacle to be one of an unexpected
      character. Hardly had any of the snakes insinuated his wriggling body into
      a hole before he found that it was in every instance full of minute
      fragments of broken glass, with the sharp points upwards, which so
      lacerated his skin that he could hardly move backwards or forwards without
      considerable pain, and some of those who had dashed forward with the
      greatest impetuosity, so injured themselves in the passage that they never
      reached the interior of the castle, but <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link197" id="link197"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p197.jpg">197</a></span>remained fixed
      in the holes which they had attempted to pass, lingering until sunset next
      day (at which time alone snakes can die), and then perishing miserably.
      The rats found a similar difficulty, but, being resolute and crafty, ran
      over the walls where they could not creep through, and arrived in the
      courtyard of the castle without losing any considerable number of their
      forces. But the toads and frogs had a rough time of it. To them it would
      have been a long and tedious business to climb over the walls, and the few
      breaches which were left temptingly open and undefended on their side of
      the attack were the only mode of entrance which they could try with any
      hopes of success. These, however, were entirely flooded with liquid tar,
      which the mannikins had poured with great care upon the flat stones and
      hard ground, and which caused the attacking party the greatest possible
      difficulty, a great many of them remaining fast stuck in the disagreeable
      mixture, until death by starvation terminated their sufferings. After a
      time, however, by dint of clambering over each other&rsquo;s bodies, a
      large number of them succeeded in obtaining an entrance, and the
      courtyards of the castle were filled with noxious creatures of all sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time not a mannikin had shown himself, and no visible sign, other
      than the obstacles which I have mentioned, had been given that the castle
      was defended by any one. The witches, who of course were close at hand,
      scarcely liked the ominous silence which prevailed on the part of their
      enemies; there was something mysterious about it which they did not
      understand. They knew, however, that their friends within must not be left
      unsupported, and accordingly sounded the advance <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link198" id="link198"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p198.jpg">198</a></span>of the reserve.
      Mother Wandle, heading a large force of bats, flew gallantly forward on
      one side; Dame Stokes, with a body of Cats and evil animals, charged on
      the other; whilst old Goody Tickleback hovered about close by on her awful
      steed, surrounded by the hooded crows and other wicked birds who had
      joined the witches&rsquo; army; for the wary old woman, who knew more
      about magic than any of her mates, had her own suspicions as to the
      possible strength of the powers arrayed against her, and had always
      determined from the first that she would throw as much of the hard work of
      fighting as she could upon the others, and, Under pretence of keeping a
      small force in reserve for contingencies, would remain outside the walls
      of the owl&rsquo;s castle. You will presently judge of her wisdom by the
      events which followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the bats On one side, and the cats on the other, passed the
      castle walls, when a voice, the loud and clear accents of which were
      distinctly heard above the cries of the assaulting party, exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Light the gas!&rdquo; and in another moment a blaze of light
      illuminated the whole place with a brightness beyond that of the sun&rsquo;s
      own rays. Every corner and crevice was lighted up with wondrous
      brilliancy, and no concealment was any longer possible for any mortal
      being. Then, in every niche of the old walls, upon the old staircases, at
      the windows, and on the crumbling ledges around, a quantity of armed
      mannikins were seen standing ready for action, whilst one window alone
      remained unlit and mysteriously dark, and there were those present who
      knew at that moment, if they had never known before, that the owl who sat
      in that window was a mighty magician, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link199" id="link199"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p199.jpg">199</a></span> and that a
      Power unseen and unfelt as yet, but too terrible for evil witches and
      their followers, dwelt within those old walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the light upon the unhappy bats was perfectly marvellous;
      dazzled and blinded, they knew not what to do nor where to fly; some
      dashed themselves up against the walls and put an end to their own lives;
      others flew straight up to the mannikins, and fell an easy prey to the
      latter, who, with their little swords drawn, stood ready to strike down
      each foeman as he approached, and dealt stout blows upon the blinded bats
      who came within their reach. Mother Wandle herself by no means relished
      her reception; she was nearly overwhelmed by her own retreating forces,
      and at the same time the light, to which she had a great objection,
      annoyed her extremely, and she began to consider that her best course
      would be to retreat as fast as possible. As she did so, however, she felt,
      to her great disgust and horror, an invisible hand, or rather claw, laid
      upon her neck, whilst a voice whispered in low but perfectly audible tones
      close to her ear&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Vile daughter of evil, who wast not afraid
The mighty Owl&rsquo;s castle and home to invade,
Do thou and thy sisters look well to this text&mdash;.
<i>A whipping the first time; beware of the next!</i>&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And, as the voice ceased, the claw was loosened from her neck, and she
      instantly felt upon her bat&rsquo;s body severe strokes as of a birch-rod
      aimed by the strong arm and unerring eye of a resolute head-master: quick
      and sharp the blows descended upon the luckless old hag, and as the skin
      of a witch (these creatures being, from the evil consciences which prevent
      their getting fat, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link200" id="link200"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p200.jpg">200</a></span>rarely burdened
      with much flesh) is proverbially tender, she suffered considerably more
      than any of my boys here at Eton would have done under similar
      circumstances. Mother Wandle, however, shrieked and fled as fast as she
      could, followed by as many of her bats as were destined to escape at all
      from that ill-fated day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dame Stokes and her cats fared but little better on their side. Although
      the light had not the same effect upon this party as upon the bats, they
      found it exceedingly disagreeable, whilst there was something else which
      affected their nerves even in a still greater degree. The mannikins who
      stood upon a portion of the inner walls of the castle exactly opposite to
      that outer wall upon which the cats had climbed to the assault, opened
      upon the latter a fire, so to speak, of a novel character. They had
      arranged and brought to bear upon this part of the wall several garden
      watering-engines of great power, numerous squirts, and the special engine
      of the Windsor Fire Brigade of that day. By means of these instruments
      they received the invaders with such a continuous volley and volume of
      water as would have checked persons to whom the element is more agreeable
      than is the case with cats. These animals have, as is well known to the
      student of natural history, an instinctive aversion to wetting their fur.
      Under the peculiar circumstances of the case, they might have put up with
      a shower of rain, or have endured a casual wetting, followed by facilities
      for drying themselves immediately afterwards. But to be received by a
      heavy and violent shower of water right in their faces, drenching them at
      once through and through, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link201" id="link201"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p201.jpg">201</a></span>and being
      immediately repeated, and continued without any intermission, was more
      than the bravest cat could bear; and as soon as they found what kind of
      reception they were to experience, no thought of shame or disgrace
      deterred the feline contingent from turning tail and retreating as fast as
      ever they could by the same way they had come, only some twenty or thirty
      dropping down within the castle wall. As they fled in this manner, the
      same mysterious voice whispered to Dame Stokes the identical words of
      warning which had greeted the ears of her sister-witch, Mother Wandle; and
      although, having assumed no other form than her own, her sex might have
      protected her from so great an indignity, I grieve to say that precisely
      the same punishment was administered to the old creature, and that so
      efficaciously that she presently fled, shrieking and rubbing herself with
      pain as she left the castle, which she devoutly wished she had never
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results which I have just described occupied barely ten minutes, and
      within a quarter of an hour the three witches, with their attendant bats,
      cats, hooded crows, and other animals who had constituted the reserve,
      were in full flight from the castle. A certain number of the snakes also
      made their escape in a curious manner. A strange-looking being, in the
      shape of a man, with a huge vessel before him, had mysteriously appeared
      near the castle wall just as the assault began, and as soon as it was
      plain that the day was going against the attacking party, he gathered up
      as many of the snakes as he could from their painful position on and about
      the walls, filled the aforesaid vessel with them (handling them all the
      while with the greatest tenderness), and throwing it on his <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link202" id="link202"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p202.jpg">202</a></span>shoulders,
      joined the witches in their headlong flight, keeping up with them in a
      manner which would have been marvellous, had not his love for the reptiles
      under whose form mankind was first tempted to sin, his wild glances, and,
      above all, the tail with which he was adorned, shown pretty clearly that
      he was Someone whom no good people can think of without hoping he is very
      far from themselves.

      As the most formidable of their adversaries thus dashed off in headlong

      All, however, was not over yet. A certain quantity of snakes, who had
      either wriggled through holes in which the broken glass had been less
      plentifully strewn, or the superior toughness of whose skin had protected
      them better than that of their comrades, were still hissing frightfully in
      the outer courtyard, which was also occupied by a considerable number of
      rats, frogs, and toads. These evil creatures, being left without the
      guidance of the witches who had lured them to the place, were in
      considerable difficulty what, to do, and their alarm and horror were great
      indeed when, loud sounding through the air, the same voice which had given
      orders for the lighting up of the castle pronounced the following words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Those who have sought to enter here,
Protected by the witches&rsquo; charm,
May learn that nought can interfere
With power of Owl to work them harm.

Within this castle&rsquo;s sacred wall,
Though mighty may the witches seem,
Their magic has no might at all&mdash;
The Owl and Nature reign supreme.

So, creatures foul, who crouch below,
Your usual instincts quickly take;
Cats, recognise your rat-like foe;
Frogs, tremble at the fangs of snake!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Even as the voice ceased the creatures to whom the above words were
      addressed seemed to feel their effects and to act at once upon the
      instructions given. Without any delay, the cats who had dropped down
      inside the castle walls on receiving the watery deluge with which the
      mannikins had greeted them, rushed with fury upon the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link204" id="link204"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p204.jpg">204</a></span>unhappy rats
      whom they saw before them, apparently forgetful of everything except those
      natural instincts which led them to destroy and eat animals whom they had
      ever been accustomed to regard as fit objects wherewith to satisfy their
      hungry appetites. At the same instant it seemed to strike the snakes that
      a perfectly legitimate opportunity had arisen for feasting upon those
      frogs who were congregated in their immediate vicinity, and, acting at
      once upon the idea, they commenced to swallow the wretched creatures
      without any unnecessary delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mannikins calmly looked down meanwhile, and watched their enemies
      destroying each other until there was scarcely a live rat or frog left in
      the place, and the toads had fled frantically into the wood for fear the
      snakes should mistake them for frogs and they should be subjected to a
      fate from which all their dabblings in magic art might not have been able
      to preserve them. When the cries of the devouring and devoured creatures
      below had pretty well ceased, and few save cats and snakes were any longer
      to be seen in the courtyard, the owl gave a signal at which the mannikins
      turned on the water which, unknown to any person save themselves and their
      master, had been laid on to supply the castle in case of fire, and which
      by a judicious arrangement of pipes could be made to flood the courtyard
      at pleasure. The gorged cats and snakes were unable to make any effort to
      escape, although the latter might probably have swum safely off, many of
      them being water-snakes, and entertaining no great objection to the
      element. But, alas for them! there was one little circumstance which
      entirely prevented it. The <i>water was boiling</i>; <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link205" id="link205"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p205.jpg">205</a></span>having been
      conducted through the kitchen of the castle, the large boilers of which
      had, by the owl&rsquo;s orders, been carefully heated for the occasion.
      The shrieks of the wretched animals were dreadful to hear, when they
      became aware of the trap in which they had been Caught and the cruel fate
      which awaited them, from which escape was hopeless. They strove in vain to
      clamber up the walls or to creep through the holes; wherever they
      succeeded in raising themselves up from the water on to the walls, the
      mannikins with drawn swords and fierce looks relentlessly pushed them back
      into the hot bath below, so that, after a space of some twenty minutes or
      so, any person who desired a meal of boiled cat and snake-sauce might have
      been easily accommodated, and every one of the wretched creatures had
      perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the castle was rid of the last of its invaders, and the mannikins had
      only to let the water off, which they did by means of a large sewer
      underneath the courtyard, the stone covering of which having been lifted
      by means of a spring worked from above, the bodies of the slain were
      washed below, and all traces of the battle and its victims were swept away
      from that part of the castle in an incredibly short space of time.
      Victory, entire and complete, now rested with the defenders of the castle,
      and their joy may he easily imagined. Not a mannikin had been slain or
      hurt, so effectually had they been protected by the power of the great
      owl, and the defeat and loss which had been inflicted upon their enemies
      had been of a character to prevent, or at all events greatly to lessen,
      the probability of any future attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link206" id="link206"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p206.jpg">206</a></span>little people
      passed the rest of the night in the most sensible and proper way possible;
      that is to say, they put out the lights and went to bed, which is a thing
      which every reasonable creature should do at a proper hour, unless he
      happens to be desirous of weakening mind and body by depriving both of
      their natural rest, and thereby shortening the term of his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mannikins were astir early the next morning, putting everything to
      rights after the confusion of the night&rsquo;s adventures. The glass was
      carefully picked out of the holes in the wall, the courtyards were
      cleaned, the bodies of those of the enemy who had fallen outside were
      decently buried, and the whole place resumed its former peaceful
      appearance within a very few hours. Then the mannikins returned to their
      usual lives; their swords were put away, their angry feelings forgotten,
      and their time spent in singing, dancing, and merriment as heretofore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the three witches were in a frame of mind by no means enviable.
      Dame Stokes and Mother Wandle still smarted considerably from the effects
      of the severe whipping which they had each received; and although Goody
      Tickleback had, by her superior cunning, escaped that disagreeable
      punishment, she suffered bitterly from mortified vanity and disappointment
      at having been so entirely defeated in the attack which she had planned
      against the castle of the mannikins. The three old women took counsel
      together as to whether there was anything more to be done against those
      whom they chose to consider their deadly enemies, or whether they had
      better give it up as a bad job. Evil, however, never sleeps or remains
      quiet if it can possibly help it, and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link207" id="link207"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p207.jpg">207</a></span>so strong was
      the spirit of evil&rsquo;s power over these wretched creatures that they
      felt themselves constrained to go on with their wicked work, and to plot
      and scheme something more against the innocent objects of their hatred.
      Their proceedings, however, had been rendered somewhat more difficult by
      the total failure which they had just experienced. They found the cats
      resolute in their refusal to embark in any further enterprises of a
      similar character to the last. The toads glared and spat dreadfully from
      fright when the subject was merely alluded to; and as to the rats, snakes,
      and frogs, they had suffered so heavily in the recent disaster that it was
      impossible to expect that anything short of absolute compulsion would
      induce a single one of them to take the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances the witches had recourse to the stoats and
      polecats, who were a fierce and bloodthirsty race, and might be of
      essential service if they could be persuaded to undertake the matter.
      Indeed, Goody Tickleback bit her lips with vexation at having forgotten to
      secure these powerful allies before, as she felt that they would have
      materially contributed to the strength of her former expedition, and
      consequently to its chance of success. Accordingly, having bribed them
      with large promises of tender young rabbits, and having paid a portion of
      the bribe in advance, which the cunning creatures insisted upon as a
      condition of their doing anything at all, the wicked old women succeeded
      in bringing a considerable army of stoats into the field, together with a
      small but compact band of polecats. The wily dames had sorely tempted the
      foxes and badgers of Windsor forest, but the former animals made various
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link208" id="link208"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p208.jpg">208</a></span>excuses, and the
      latter, having consulted a famous old badger who lived at that time in the
      Brocas clump, declined altogether to have anything to do with the matter.
      So the three witches led forth their army, composed only of the animals I
      have mentioned, and arranged to cross the river upon a certain evening.
      The particular place upon which they had fixed to cross was at a
      considerable distance from any bridge, and some of these animals therefore
      had to swim, whilst those who could not or would not do so were provided
      with boats and rafts constructed by the magic powers of the old women.
      They themselves flew over in the usual manner, one as a bat, another on
      her famous broomstick, and the third on her awful steed. Then they stood
      on the opposite bank, awaiting their army, who, when they had finished all
      their preparations, sharpened their teeth and claws, and made other
      necessary arrangements, plunged into the river, and began to follow their
      leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now occurred one of the most singular scenes which it has ever been my
      good fortune to witness since I first presided over the destinies of this
      noble river. I have seen a great many strange things and people, Brother
      Rhine, and been a spectator of a great many curious sights. Moreover,
      during a long period of years, I have carefully inquired into and studied
      the natural habits and ways of living which distinguish the numerous
      animals, birds, and beasts which inhabit the banks and waters of my
      stream, in all of whom, indeed, I have ever taken that lively interest
      which becomes a person in my position. But I may as well frankly tell you
      at once that nothing ever astonished me more than the scene which followed
      the attempt of the stoats and polecats to cross <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link209" id="link209"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p209.jpg">209</a></span>the river in
      order to attack the owl&rsquo;s castle. They got nearly half-way across
      without anybody offering to dispute their passage. Then, all of a sudden,
      a strange, wild sound was heard, and a song was borne down upon the breeze
      which I knew full well as the war-song of the noble swans who honour my
      river by making it their home, and who are well known as the finest and
      handsomest swans in all Christendom.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;The swan swam up the stream;
Swim, swan, swim!
The swan swam down again;
Well swam, swan!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This was the whole of the song; the words are simple, and apparently
      convey no particular meaning, being little more than the statement of a
      fact which may without difficulty be accepted as true, coupled with an
      expression of approval of the manner in which the bird in question had
      performed a natural and not uncongenial task. But if you were to hear this
      song sung by a number of swans together, all keeping tune exactly, and
      sailing down upon you as they sung, with flashing eyes and arched necks,
      evidently actuated by no friendly feeling, it is very doubtful whether you
      would care much about either the words or their meaning, and not
      improbable that you would prefer to be somewhat farther off from the
      sounds of the entrancing melody. So at least it certainly was with the
      allies of the witches, when a body of at least fifty or sixty swans (being
      a larger number than I had ever previously seen together in any part of my
      river) suddenly appeared sailing down upon them at full speed. It was
      altogether a most extraordinary proceeding on the part of the noble birds,
      who, although <span class="pagenum"><a name="link210" id="link210"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p210.jpg">210</a></span>ready and most
      able to defend themselves if attacked, are generally of a quiet and
      peaceful nature, and had hitherto, as far as my knowledge went, interfered
      with none of the other dwellers in or near the river, but lived in
      friendship and harmony with all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their intentions, however, upon the present occasion were never for a
      moment doubtful after their first appearance. They charged down upon the
      army of stoats and polecats with a force and velocity which rendered
      resistance impossible. The boats and rafts were at once overset by the
      impetuous fury of their attack, and the occupants thereof were in another
      instant struggling in the waters. Nor did the swimmers fare any better,
      for the powerful blows inflicted by a swan&rsquo;s beak in every instance
      either stunned the animal struck, or so disabled him that he could swim no
      farther, but sank beneath the water to rise no more. The wretched
      creatures could do nothing to defend themselves, for the swans were too
      wary to approach their breasts near enough to any of the savage little
      animals to allow of their getting hold of their soft feathers. They kept
      far enough off for their own safety, after once upsetting the boats, and
      yet sufficiently near to deal out the pecks of death upon the struggling
      carcases with little or no risk to themselves. They utterly broke through
      and dispersed at once the line of the swimming and floating army, and
      then, turning round and coming up stream, slew multitudes of the wretched
      animals as they swam for their lives one way or another. A very few
      moments sufficed for the total rout of the witches&rsquo; army, not one of
      which ever reached the shore to which they were bound, though a few
      managed to swim back in safety, and those who had been <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link211" id="link211"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p211.jpg">211</a></span>only just about
      to enter the river naturally gave up any further idea of doing so, and
      fled in great confusion back to the shelter of the forest from which they
      had come. The swans, meanwhile, who had ceased singing their war-song as
      soon as they reached the enemy, and had commenced a violent and angry
      hissing, which they only suspended when they bowed their heads in order to
      peck an enemy to his death, now recommenced their musical strains so soon
      as they had completely routed and destroyed the invading army, and swam
      back up the river with heads elevated high in the air, shaking themselves
      now and then with an air of conscious strength and exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the progress of these events, Brother Rhine, the state of mind and
      general feelings of the three witches may be better imagined than
      described. They wept, they howled, they tore what hair they had, they used
      language with which I will not sully my lips, and manifested every token
      of frantic rage and consternation. Charms and incantations they would have
      tried, but they knew well enough that they had no power whatever over
      things or beings in my sacred waters. The swans only laughed at their wild
      fury and strange gesticulations, and the old women remained upon the bank,
      perfectly helpless. Once more their plans against the owl and his
      mannikins had utterly failed; and they saw the destruction of the army
      which they had taken so much pains to raise, without the smallest power to
      avert the catastrophe which again dashed their fondest hopes to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of the scene which had terminated so disagreeably to
      themselves, the witches, having nearly <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link212" id="link212"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p212.jpg">212</a></span>exhausted
      themselves with their rage, calmed down a little, and began to look at
      each other and wonder what they should do next. This, however, was not a
      matter long left within their own choice; even as they stood, the heavens
      grew dark with a mysterious and unnatural darkness, low mutterings of
      distant thunder were heard, and the wind wailed mournfully as it swept
      across the river and through the trees of the adjoining wood in which
      stood the castle of the mannikins.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep and distant terror seized upon the three witches as these things
      occurred; they felt, somehow or other, that those were near against whom
      their magic arts were powerless, and that some wonderful and awful
      Presence was at hand which they could neither withstand nor avoid.
      Trembling in every limb, they cowered upon the bank, shivering as if with
      cold, their teeth chattering, their eyes ready to start out of their heads
      with fright, and their hearts beating with that fear of coming judgment
      which wickedness always brings sooner or later to hearts that conceive and
      practise it. Some internal and inscrutable feeling seemed to warn them
      that their hour of punishment was near, and that retribution was at hand&mdash;retribution
      for all the pain and misery which they had caused to others ever since
      they first sold themselves to work evil instead of endeavouring to lead
      good and pious lives, and to be a comfort instead of a plague and torment
      to their fellow-creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suspense which they endured during this time was probably something
      more terribly painful than one can imagine, and the uncertainty of their
      coming doom made it all the more dreadful in anticipation. This state of
      things lasted for some little while, and a stillness, solemn <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link213" id="link213"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p213.jpg">213</a></span>and awful in its
      intensity, reigned around. The wind fell again, and the sound of thunder
      ceased; only the old river went rolling on in its calm, ceaseless stream,
      the soothing ripple of which smote upon the ear of the unhappy witches as
      the solemn tones of a judge must fall upon the guilty criminal before him.
      Each moment seemed an hour to the terror-stricken old hags, and I imagine
      that no child who has waited in a dentist&rsquo;s room until that popular
      operator was ready for him has ever endured half the agony of expectation
      which was experienced at this time by the three witches.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the silence was broken, and that in a manner which it would have
      been impossible for them to have anticipated. The low roll of a drum was
      heard in the wood, which sound swelled gradually upon the ear, and was
      then mingled with other martial music, evidently betokening the approach
      of an army. In a few moments more there issued from the direction of the
      owl&rsquo;s castle a strange and unwonted procession. First of all came a
      splendid array of cock pheasants, gay with their bright and gaudy colours,
      and carrying their well-known banner of dark blue, in the centre of which
      is depicted a magnificent bird of their species looking round with a
      defiant air, whilst underneath him is inscribed the celebrated motto of
      his race&mdash;&ldquo;Game to the last.&rdquo; The pheasants were followed
      by a strong detachment of partridges, each with his brown horseshoe
      strongly developed upon his breast, whilst a golden wheat-sheaf upon a
      banner of russet brown, and the motto, &ldquo;Hurrah for the
      harvest-fields!&rdquo; showed the character of the regiment. They were
      followed by a body of woodcocks and snipes, marching <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link214" id="link214"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p214.jpg">214</a></span>in alternate
      ranks, and displaying their respective banners, being a bird of each race
      worked in blue upon a white ground, and represented as tossing his long
      beak high in the air and saying, in the inscription below, &ldquo;Settle
      my bill if you can!&rdquo; To these succeeded a gallant regiment of
      bantams, whose arrogant motto, &ldquo;Cock of the walk,&rdquo; was
      displayed upon their crimson flags; whilst the &ldquo;Come back! come
      back!&rdquo; of the Guinea-fowl was seen upon the banners of the next
      comers. Other bands of birds followed, each with its own peculiar standard
      and device, and all marched in slow and solemn order from the wood to the
      music already mentioned, which was played by an invisible band within the
      leafy shade of the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      As each regiment emerged from the wood, it advanced within a stone&rsquo;s
      throw of the three witches, and took up ground at that distance, so that
      the old women found a semicircle gradually forming around them, which
      extended on all sides save that on which the river flowed. When numerous
      companies of birds had arrived and taken their places, there next appeared
      a strong detachment of squirrels&mdash;animals to which it is well known
      that witches entertain a peculiar dislike, on account of the restless
      activity of their nature, and their constant habit of dropping nutshells
      suddenly on the heads of persons engaged in unholy incantations and rites
      in the forests wherein they happen to dwell. The old women shuddered
      afresh then, when these creatures appeared upon the scene, especially as
      they came on, each armed with a bag of nuts, and with eyes full of
      mischief. They were followed by a quantity of rabbits, whose grave and
      martial appearance would have led you to suppose that there <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link215" id="link215"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p215.jpg">215</a></span>were no such
      things as weasels or ferrets in the world; and after the rabbits came the
      principal part of the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than one hundred mannikins, fully armed and equipped, rode out of the
      wood, each mounted upon a prancing hare. Their saddles were made of
      mouse-skin, their bridles were of the best red tape, and their
      tortoiseshell bits rattled in the mouths of their fiery steeds. Each
      mannikin had upon his head a burnished helmet of mother-of-pearl, in which
      was a plume from the wing of a kingfisher, and the armour of each was of
      the best wrought tin, and sparkled gaily in the sunlight, which now again
      spread over the heavens as the troops emerged from the trees. The
      mannikins rode forward in loose order, whilst immediately after them came
      a close carriage, drawn by twelve cream-coloured hares, and surrounded by
      twenty mannikins on either side, and a number of owls of every species and
      description following behind. The mannikins who had ridden in front gave
      way when they approached the witches, falling back on either side so as to
      allow the carriage to pass between their ranks. It drew up immediately
      before the three trembling hags, and the attendant mannikins, bowing low
      and uncovering their heads, opened the doors for its occupant to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can have little doubt, Brother Rhine, as to who that occupant was,
      nor, indeed, was doubt long permitted to the personages most immediately
      interested in the drama about to be performed. From forth the carriage
      stepped a figure which all at the same moment recognised as that of the
      black owl of the castle. Not long, however, did he remain in the shape in
      which his audience <span class="pagenum"><a name="link216" id="link216"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p216.jpg">216</a></span>were most
      accustomed to behold him. Throwing back the head-dress and feathery cloak
      which begirt him, the figure of a noble youth stood before the astonished
      witches. His head was thrown back in contemptuous scorn, his eyes flashed
      with the indignation which virtue always experiences in the presence of
      vice; he stretched forth his hand, in which was grasped an ash stick,
      carefully peeled, so that it shone fresh and white, and this he waved
      gently in the air as he spoke in clear and sounding accents&mdash;&ldquo;Vile
      hags!&rdquo; he exclaimed; and as he uttered the words, Dame Stokes,
      Mother Wandle, and Groody Tickleback fell on their knees, whining and
      moaning in piteous tones&mdash;&ldquo;Vile hags! once more have ye
      presumed to tempt your fate by plotting and scheming the destruction of my
      mannikins. The warning which ye had previously received seems to have
      produced no effect whatever upon ye, and ye will now have to endure the
      punishment ye have so well earned!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the old women grovelled on the earth at his feet, and mumbled
      forth in low and beseeching accents, &ldquo;Oh, sir! <i>please</i> let us
      off this time; just this once; it is the first time&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
      never, never, do it again. <i>Please</i> &lsquo;give us first fault&rsquo;!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This expression, always well known among witches, and intended to express
      the forgiveness of an offence because of its being on that occasion
      committed for the first time, appeared greatly to increase the anger of
      the person addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First fault!&rdquo; he exclaimed, indignantly, &ldquo;why, how dare
      you utter such a falsehood? You have been complained of a dozen times at
      least by my mannikins, and I <span class="pagenum"><a name="link217"
      id="link217"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p217.jpg">217</a></span>have
      only spared you hitherto from a hope that you might reform, and give up
      your evil practices. You have not only made yourselves the pest of the
      whole place for a long time past, but you have now for the second time
      projected an attack upon the castle which I specially protect. First fault
      indeed! Two of you were well flogged the other day, and there is now
      nothing for it but to send you away altogether.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the wretched creatures burst into a howl of anguish, upon
      which the young man waved his hand, and a burst of sound arose from the
      invisible band, in which the tones of the bagpipe were distinctly audible,
      and which completely drowned the cries of the miserable witches. As soon
      as the latter and the music had ceased together, the young man continued
      to speak in a voice as stern as clear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have hesitated,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as to the precise
      punishment which I should inflict upon each of you, for indeed I hardly
      know of any which is sufficiently severe for the crimes which you have
      committed. I had thought, indeed, of transforming you into shapes
      different from your own, but still possessing human form, and causing you
      to experience in them the greatest trouble and misery to which human life
      is subject. I have still a great mind to do so. I am very much disposed to
      make one of you a leader in the world of fashion, the second a Member of
      Parliament, and the third the Head Master of a Public School, which is
      under the control of a Governing Body.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point such a dreadful shriek broke simultaneously from the three
      witches, that the squirrels were obliged to be called in and ordered to
      pelt them with nuts, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link218" id="link218"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p218.jpg">218</a></span>until they again
      crouched trembling but silent on the ground before their judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued he, without noticing the interruption,
      &ldquo;it shall never be said of me that I was guilty of unnecessary
      cruelty. There <i>are</i>, I must own, punishments too severe even for
      crimes such as yours, and among such these might possibly be included. As
      I am a great and powerful, so am I a merciful fairy, and I shall not award
      you one iota of suffering more than is your due. Dame Stokes of Datchet,
      though bad enough, you are in some respects the best of the three. You
      have at least, as a rule, preserved your natural form; and could you but
      have persuaded yourself to give up that abominable, not to say ridiculous,
      habit of riding on a broomstick, you might have passed through life with
      all the ordinary comforts of an English peasant, and ended your days in
      respectability and the parish workhouse. Since, however, you have
      persisted in using as a horse that which was intended as a harmless and
      useful domestic implement, you must pay the penalty of your indiscretion.
      You will be changed into a donkey, and as such may remain in your native
      place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dame Stokes was just commencing a loud howl at the news of her impending
      fate, when a gaily attired young mannikin stepped before the fairy, and,
      making a low obeisance, craved leave to speak, which was at once
      graciously accorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble master,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if a poor mannikin may put in
      a word, is this sentence one which requires any transformation at all? A
      person who, being able to ride on anything else, chooses a broomstick,
      must already be such <span class="pagenum"><a name="link219" id="link219"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p219.jpg">219</a></span>a donkey as to
      render a further change in the same direction quite unnecessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great fairy smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words are true, my child,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;in one
      sense, but they only tend to confirm the wisdom of my sentence. A donkey
      in thought and action is not always a donkey in shape. Were it otherwise,
      the world would be much more largely populated by those worthy and
      industrious animals. It is no terrible fate to which I condemn the aged
      Stokes. She will forthwith enter upon an existence in which she may render
      no inconsiderable service to mortals, who, whilst they despise, will not
      scruple to use her; and should she, as is highly probable, at any period
      of time, become the property of an itinerant vendor of brooms, she will
      have every chance of acquiring a further knowledge of the purposes to
      which a broomstick may be properly applied.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke, and as he concluded, a change at once came over the figure and
      appearance of Dame Stokes. Great ears sprung up on each side of her head,
      which became at once altered and elongated into that of a donkey; her body
      followed the example; a huge tail appeared in the usual place allotted to
      such appendages, and in another moment she stood, a veritable ass, before
      the assembled throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young man turned to the terrified Mother Wandle, and sternly
      addressed her in her turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though not so bad as the third, are
      worse than the first of your party. Not content with your own shape (which
      I will, however, own was not prepossessing), you have gone about the
      country in disguise, and have, moreover, disgraced the family of bats
      (many of <span class="pagenum"><a name="link220" id="link220"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p220.jpg">220</a></span>whom are honest
      and owl-fearing creatures) by-assuming the shape of one of them, and in
      this form perpetrating your wicked deeds. Now one of two things must be
      true. Either you were <i>not</i> by rights a bat, and had therefore no
      right to the shape of one, or, being a bat, you had no business to
      disgrace the family. In either case you are equally guilty, and your
      punishment must be proportionately severe. Since you have evinced, by the
      most practical means within your power, the undoubted preference which you
      cherish for the form of a bat, a bat you shall remain for ever, and, once
      for all, quit that human shape which you have so foolishly despised.
      Henceforth be your life that of the animal whom you have loved to imitate
      in your midnight flittings. Behind shutters, under eaves, beneath old
      boards and barn-sides be hidden, wretch, from the face of the sun, and
      only come forth when the shades of evening steal over the face of the
      earth. Shun the gaze of mankind, whom you have only lived to annoy, and
      rank for the rest of your existence amongst the most lowly and feeble of
      animals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke, and, as in the case of Dame Stokes, the form and figure of
      Mother Wandle changed even as he ceased speaking, and a huge and unsightly
      bat occupied the place of the old woman, whilst a murmur of applause and
      approval was uttered by all who witnessed the transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the owl-fairy turned upon the wretched Goody Tickleback, who stood in
      gloomy silence awaiting the doom which she full well knew her crimes had
      deserved, but which was not likely to be one whit more palatable on that
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vile <span class="pagenum"><a name="link221" id="link221"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p221.jpg">221</a></span>and degraded
      creature,&rdquo; exclaimed the fairy, regarding the object of his address
      with a stern and angry countenance, &ldquo;you have at last been brought
      to account for your numerous crimes, which exceed those of your companions
      in guilt, and have rightly made you detested by every one to whom you are
      known. You have gone on for a long time in your nefarious course,
      unchecked by any consideration for those innocent beings against whom your
      evil practices have been directed, and undeterred either by the pangs of
      that remorse, which must at times have overshadowed even such a hardened
      soul as yours, or by the fear of that punishment which, though long
      deferred, was certain to arrive at last. In your life you have exhibited
      the ferocity of a tiger, the cruelty of an hyÃ¦na, and the craft of a
      serpent. A serpent therefore you shall be for the future, and as you have,
      like the rest of your fraternity, always entertained a great horror of
      water, you shall be consigned for ever to that element, and become a
      sea-serpent for the rest of your existence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild yell broke from Goody Tickleback as these words left the lips of
      the royal fairy, and she burst forth into a desperate cry for a mitigation
      of so terrible a sentence..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! oh no!&rdquo; she shrieked aloud in the madness of her
      despair; &ldquo;not that, not that, for mercy&rsquo;s sake! anything but
      that! Make me a stone, or a stick, or a good birch-rod if you will, great
      fairy. I promise I will act up to my name, and tickle with good-will every
      back that comes under me, if you will only make me this instead of a
      horrible snake. Oh do! oh do! oh don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And <span class="pagenum"><a name="link222" id="link222"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p222.jpg">222</a></span>she ended her
      speech with a yell more awful than before as she felt the dreadful
      transformation which had been awarded begin slowly but surely to steal
      over her decrepit frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fairy smiled coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel to the last,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;The vile hag would be
      made an instrument of torture in an inanimate shape, since she may no
      longer torment people in her original form. But it may not be. The doom
      has been pronounced, and already begins to take effect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke, the form of the old woman gradually changed into that of
      an enormous sea-serpent, and her yells culminated in a fearful hissing,
      from which the legions of valiant birds instinctively recoiled. A scaly
      monster of the deep occupied the place&mdash;and rather more than the
      place&mdash;lately filled by old Goody Tickle-back, and the last of the
      three witches had now received her allotted punishment. The owl-fairy then
      struck the ground sharply three times with his ashen stick, and each of
      the three culprits departed different ways. The donkey stretched out its
      tail, erected its ears, elevated its head, and gave vent to sundry of
      those loud and discordant noises by which creatures of that particular
      species are distinguished from other four-footed beasts. Then, looking
      around once more, it slowly set off at a trot, which presently became a
      galop; and, passing through the ranks of the bird and mannikin army, which
      divided for its passage, took the direction of Datchet, and hastened
      thither as fast as it could lay legs to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not follow the adventures of the poor beast any longer, though I
      may as well tell you, Brother. Rhine, that <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link223" id="link223"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p223.jpg">223</a></span>I know for a
      fact she lingered in the same neighbourhood for a very long time. Indeed,
      not many weeks since, whilst walking upon Dorney Common, I heard cries as
      of an animal in distress, and, looking round, beheld a seller of brooms
      vehemently belabouring a half-starved ass with a broomstick. The poor
      beast was in sad condition. It was laden with a heavy load of brooms, and
      its speaking eyes seemed to tell of much privation and suffering. I seemed
      somehow or other to remember the expression of the face, and in a few
      moments recalled the circumstances of which I have just been telling you.
      There indeed was old Dame Stokes, serving out her time in long
      apprenticeship to misery and punishment, and experiencing that practical
      application of the broomstick which the owl-fairy had foretold. I passed
      on my way to the river, and sighed as I thought over her fate, pondering
      meanwhile upon the melancholy fact that sin should be so attractive as it
      had proved to this old woman, when its punishment, sooner or later, is so
      certain and is of so much more enduring a character than the questionable
      pleasure which has earned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Mother Wandle, there is but little to tell of her. As soon as she
      was permitted to do so, she flitted away across my river in the direction
      of Windsor Forest, and, for anything I know, may be there still. Bats are
      not creatures that one ever hears much of, nor have I been accustomed to
      interest myself particularly in their proceedings; but if you happen to
      see an especially ugly and repulsive bat, it is quite as likely to be old
      Mother Wandle as anybody else, and you may be sure that she is still
      enduring the punishment so justly inflicted upon her by a righteous judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goody <span class="pagenum"><a name="link224" id="link224"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p224.jpg">224</a></span>Tickleback&rsquo;s
      exit from the scene was of a more marked and singular character. It would
      have been difficult to have disposed of so gigantic a monster by any
      ordinary process. It could not have travelled by land to the ocean, except
      on wheels; and although it might have been possible to have paid expenses
      by sending it thither in the caravan of a travelling showman&mdash;supposing
      a vehicle of that description, and of sufficiently large size, to have
      been in being&mdash;such a course would have been scarcely consistent with
      the usage of fairyland, or with the nature and circumstances of the case.
      It might, of course, have been possible to have floated the creature down
      the waters of my river, but against such a proceeding my nymphs, elves,
      and swans would have protested indignantly, even had I been disposed for a
      moment to sanction it. Besides this, the inconvenience to traffic, and the
      bad odour which so foul a reptile would leave in the water, not to mention
      its possible indulgence in some mischievous and destructive habits which
      would have brought the river into bad repute, were all difficulties in the
      way. I could not allow a &ldquo;Thames nuisance&rdquo; to be thus
      originated which would have been probably fraught with most unpleasant
      consequences, and could have done no possible good to anybody. This,
      therefore, being out of the question, it only remained for the owl-fairy
      to exercise his magic power somewhat further, and get rid of the vast and
      cumbrous body which he had seen fit to create. The wonderful being made
      not the slightest difficulty. Waving his rod three times above his head,
      and describing with it a circle in the air, he struck upon the ground,
      which immediately opened wide beneath the hideous <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link225" id="link225"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p225.jpg">225</a></span>serpent, and
      exhibited an enormous chasm, down which it slowly disappeared, and was
      seen no more in those regions of the earth.

    <p>
      Marvellous legends, however, have been told of the great Sea-serpent since
      that day, and those who know the circumstances which I have related are
      able to judge of their truth better than the ignorant and unlearned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times, when, far out at sea, the waves are running mountains high, the
      ship can scarce weather the storm, and some of the affrighted sailors have
      betaken themselves to their boats in hopes to preserve their lives, a
      hideous monster is said to rise from the deep, encircling and crushing the
      boat with its gigantic coil, and striking with its cruel fangs the
      drowning mariners. At other times, when all is calm, and the surface of
      the ocean ripples softly, like a lake stirred by the zephyrs&rsquo;
      softest breath, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link226" id="link226"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p226.jpg">226</a></span>a huge and awful
      form may be seen floating on the waves, slowly making its way through the
      waters, and ever and anon raising its hideous serpent-head aloft, as if in
      search of something to injure or destroy. Wonderful tales do the sailor
      men bring home of this extraordinary creature, and wise folk oftentimes
      shake their heads and affect to disbelieve in its existence. But we,
      Brother Rhine, who know this chronicle of early days which I have just
      been telling, shake no heads over the matter, and entertain no doubt of
      the reality of the sight which the sons of Neptune aver that they have
      seen. Old Goody Tickleback is the great Sea-serpent, and my only wonder is
      that, when the great owl-fairy was about it, he did not put her out of the
      way altogether, instead of leaving her in a position in which she could
      still work so much mischief to mortal men. I suppose, however, that
      fairies, like other people, know their own business best; and there was
      probably some reason against this self-evidently wise course which does
      not occur to those who do not happen themselves to be fairies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner, anyhow, the three witches were comfortably disposed of,
      and, to my mind, there never was a clearer case of &ldquo;a good riddance
      of bad rubbish.&rdquo; Having accomplished his task, the owl-fairy now
      reentered his carriage, and directed the troops to pass before him, which
      they accordingly did, each company saluting as it passed. The review being
      finished, the whole procession returned to the wood in the same order as
      that in which they had emerged from it, and in a very short time the banks
      of the river were as quiet as if nothing unusual had happened. The
      mannikins were never <span class="pagenum"><a name="link227" id="link227"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p227.jpg">227</a></span>afterwards
      molested by witches or any such nefarious customers, and, as long as they
      chose to inhabit the castle, they were perfectly free from disturbance or
      attack. Time at last did its work upon the old walls, and when the hum of
      the steam-engine began to be heard in the land this was no longer a place
      for mannikins. They flitted I know not where, and the owl-fairy doubtless
      went with them. I could perhaps tell you more, but melancholy thoughts
      come over me as I speak of the departure of old friends and neighbours,
      and I think, with your good leave, I will here bring my legend to a
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, good brother,&rdquo; said the Monarch of the Rhine, as
      Father Thames ceased speaking. &ldquo;Yet would I fain inquire who or what
      was this great owl-fairy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion smiled grimly. &ldquo;Hast thou so soon forgotten thine own
      objection to questions concerning our legends when finished?&rdquo; he
      asked. &ldquo;Nevertheless I would tell thee if I could, but I fear to
      speak with certainty upon a subject which has ever been shrouded in doubt.
      Most authorities agree that this mighty being could be none other than he
      of whom mention was made in my first legend&mdash;that of the Wild Boar of
      Windsor Forest. But the great fairy, Toddlekins, did not announce himself
      on the occasion of the transformation of the three witches; and the only
      proof that it was he who reigned over the mannikins and delivered them
      from their enemies consists in the similarity of his appearance with that
      of the rescuer of Smith in the Druid days. I incline to think it may have
      been him; and we know that wherever Toddlekins has power good prevails
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link228" id="link228"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p228.jpg">228</a></span>and evil flies
      from his presence; but more I cannot tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, brother,&rdquo; returned he of the Rhine; &ldquo;the
      matter, anyhow, ended well, and I would that my Rhineland had a fairy
      Toddlekins as well as thy favoured country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Thames smiled grimly. &ldquo;There never could be two such as
      Toddlekins in this world,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;and it is a blessing
      for me and mine that there has been one. But come, Brother Rhine, there is
      yet time for another legend. Hast thou none of the old war times, and of
      the brave German barons who fought so oft and so fiercely?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that have I, many an one,&rdquo; responded the other. &ldquo;I
      bethink me, moreover, of one which is not strictly or wholly of mine own
      land, nor in truth do I know precisely to what land it can be said
      entirely to belong. It is one, however, which has been handed down to us

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Object, indeed!&rdquo; cried jolly old Father Thames in a pleasant
      voice. &ldquo;How or why should I object? Are not some of our very best
      English legends told in verse? Witness that excellent old story of&mdash;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
'Old King Cole was a merry old soul,
And so was old King Tudor;
But merrier still was Miss Mary Cole,
When the Earl of Pembroke woo&rsquo;d her.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      That <i>is</i> a fine legend, if you please! I heard it all told by a
      descendant of the Cole family, who stumbled on the story in an old
      manuscript, and instantly went out to Cannes, in the South of France,
      where he studied it carefully <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link229" id="link229"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p229.jpg">229</a></span>with a view to
      producing it for the benefit of the English public, and was only prevented
      from doing so by his sisters, who insisted upon it that the wooing done in
      their family, even at a remote period, was a matter of private history
      which should never be allowed to become public property. Perhaps they had
      some affair of the same kind in hand themselves, and did not want to
      establish an inconvenient precedent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; remarked the Rhine King somewhat sulkily;
      &ldquo;but if you go on like this I shall never get away. Pray give a
      fellow a chance, and don&rsquo;t keep all the talk to yourself&mdash;you
      and your Coles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold hard!&rdquo; cried Father Thames at this. &ldquo;I am not
      going to be &lsquo;called over the coals&rsquo; by any foreigner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce to your puns!&rdquo; said he of the Rhine; and as Father
      Thames said no more, he at once began the song of:&mdash;

    <h2>
      SIR RODERICK FOWLE&mdash;A LEGEND OF THE OLDEN TIME.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I.

Sir Roderick Fowle has returned from the East,
Where believers are fighting the Paynim;
Though they slaughtered his squire, and they wounded his beast,
No Saracen foeman has slain him.

II.

He has crossed the salt seas, and has come to the land
Where no man of battle afraid is,
But all have, in war, a keen blade and strong hand,
And, in peace, a true heart for the ladies.

III.

To <span class="pagenum"><a name="link230" id="link230"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p230.jpg">230</a></span>the land of the Gaul is Sir Roderick come
(Concluded his Saracen fighting),
And with joy and delight is struck perfectly dumb,
On the shores of his country alighting&mdash;

IV.

The land where he&rsquo;d lived as an innocent child
(And now he&rsquo;s a vigorous man, see!),
Where Ida, the lovely, had first on him smiled
And captured his heart and his fancy.

V.

Sweet Ida, the daughter of Montmolon&rsquo;s lord
(How blest to possess such a daughter!),
Was fairest of fair demoiselles&mdash;in a word,
All the marrying bachelors sought her.

VI.

But &ldquo;attentions&rdquo; she cared for but little, said she,
And, really, seemed scarcely to heed&rsquo;em;
And for marrying! oh! &rsquo;twas like &ldquo;felo de se,&rdquo;
 If you <i>could</i> keep your spinsterly freedom.

VII.

So she turned up her aquiline nose at them all,
And refused a round dozen of offers
From lords and from knights, who would constantly fall
At her feet with their hearts and their coffers.

VIII.

Till fate in her way threw Sir Roderick Fowle,
Before he departed this war on,
Then love made the damsel as blind as an owl,
And she promised herself to the Baron.

IX.

The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link231" id="link231"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p231.jpg">231</a></span>war was declared&mdash;there was no time to woo,
When legions and armies were forming,
But, handsome and bold, he knew well what to do,
So he carried the fortress by storming.

X.

And she promised to wed, if he shouldn&rsquo;t be dead,
When the Christians had settled the Paynim.
He must go there, he said; but she wanted, instead,
By her apron-string still to detain him.

XI.

But he&rsquo;d promised to go, and he would, and he must
(These men are such obstinate cattle!),
So his heart to her keeping the lover did trust,
And set off, like a man, to the battle.

XII.

He went, and he came, and sustained his great name,
For when was a Fowle e&rsquo;er behindhand?
And returned to receive the sweet laurels of fame
From his Ida&rsquo;s most willing and kind hand.

XIII.

When a man&rsquo;s seeking <i>laurels</i>, to keep him at <i>bay</i>
Is a deed most exceedingly cruel,
So we&rsquo;ll hasten our baron along on his way
To the casket which held his bright jewel.

XIV.

Lofty and high were the Montmolon towers,
And fortified, too, beyond measure,
Lest any bold lord of the neighbouring powers
Should harry the Montmolon treasure.

XV.

Sir <span class="pagenum"><a name="link232" id="link232"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p232.jpg">232</a></span>Roderick gazed on the gloomy old wall,
Which the ivy was slowly corroding,
When a sight met his eyes which his heart did appal,
And fill with a fearful foreboding.

XVI.

Where the Montmolon banner of old used to wave,
And merrily flaunt in the breezes,
No banner hung now&mdash;all was still as the grave,
Or the form that death&rsquo;s quietude seizes.

XVII.

The place looked so bleak&mdash;&lsquo;tis a sad thing to speak,
But sad things sometimes must be spoken;
And the winds they did shriek through that castle antique,
For there wasn&rsquo;t a window unbroken!

XVIII.

The mark of a foe did Sir Roderick know
Full well&mdash;far too well to mistake it;
And he groaned deep and low, in sad accents of woe,
Ere he turned round his horse to forsake it.

XIX.

But he stopped; for a groan quite as sad as his own
Seemed to come from the shrubberies near him,
And an old man he spied, sitting there all alone,
Who appeared in no manner to fear him.

XX.

He approached, and affright half gave way to delight
At the chance his lost bride to regain her,
When he recognised quite, in this dolorous wight,
A Montmolon former retainer.

XXI.

&ldquo;Old <span class="pagenum"><a name="link233" id="link233"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p233.jpg">233</a></span>man!&rdquo; he cried out, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this fuss all about?
And has there been any disaster?
You seemed crippled, no doubt: is&rsquo;t rheumatics or gout?
And where are your mistress and master?&rdquo;

XXII.

With a guttural sigh, like one going to die,
The man raised him up on his knees, and
Thus made him reply, though the news, by-the-bye,
He scarce could get out of his weasand.

XXIII.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a sad tale to crack. Noble sir, you&rsquo;ve come back
To a house sacked from basement to attics;
Too long do I lack kitchen chimney and jack
For gout&mdash;let alone the rheumatics!

XXIV.

&ldquo;I speak but with pain, for I&rsquo;m slaughtered and slain
(Just look at my garments all gory),
But my breath I would fain a while longer retain
Till I&rsquo;ve told you our terrible story.

XXV.

&ldquo;Fair Ida, I fear, you will scarcely find here,
Though the room which was hers still you may see,
For &lsquo;tis nearly a year since with bow and with spear
Hither hastened Sir Marmaduke Tracy.

XXVI.

&ldquo;With soldiers in scores, ammunition, and stores,
He attacked our unfortunate village;
He battered our doors (&lsquo;twas the greatest of bores).
And allowed all his people to pillage.

XXVII.

&ldquo;When <span class="pagenum"><a name="link234" id="link234"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p234.jpg">234</a></span>the storm &lsquo;gan to lower, folks fled to the tower,
Young and old the same thing very soon did;
We did all in our power, and young Ida&rsquo;s own bower
Was turned into a ward for the wounded.

XXVIII.

&ldquo;For months four or five we continued to strive;
None ventured on shirking or shamming,
Till one-half of our hive were no longer alive&mdash;
Consumed between firing and famine.

XXIX.

&ldquo;When our lord &lsquo;gainst the rout could no longer hold out,
He gave in, like a sensible covey;
No food was about, save one bottle of stout,
Half a loaf, and a pot of anchovy.

XXX.

&ldquo;Then at length did we let (though with wondrous regret)
Sir Marmaduke through the portcullis;
And the treatment we met no one there will forget,
Unless he a regular gull is.

XXXI.

&ldquo;The Tracy began, and took ev&rsquo;ry tenth man &lsquo;
Of the Baron of Montmolon&rsquo;s people,
Saying, &lsquo;Fly, if ye can, for ye soon will be dan&mdash;
Cling from top of the neighbouring steeple.

XXXII.

&ldquo;&lsquo;Since ye foolishly list, Tracy&rsquo;s arms to resist,
Ye shall see how his mercy shall treat ye;
And your wives shall be kissed, if by them ye are missed
In your homes, while the carrion eat ye.&rsquo;

XXXIII.

&ldquo;His <span class="pagenum"><a name="link235" id="link235"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p235.jpg">235</a></span>men had the knack; not a rope was too slack,
Not a victim could loosen or slip cord.
Our baron looked black; but his arms &lsquo;hind his back
Were fastened together with whipcord.

XXXIV.

&ldquo;He hanged these poor chaps, but I fancy that, perhaps,
The other men&rsquo;s lot was the sorest;
Without clothes, shoes, or caps, but with plenty of slaps,
He turned them adrift in the forest.

XXXV.

&ldquo;Some starved, sank, and died; some few went beside
Themselves with cold, hunger, and sorrow.
'Twas little you spied of the Montmolon pride,
When you looked at this place on the morrow.

XXXVI.

&ldquo;That truculent Goth, Sir Tracy, took both
Our lord and his beautiful daughter.
'To wed me,&rsquo; he quoth, &lsquo;though the damsel be loth,
To reason I soon shall have brought her.&rsquo;

XXXVII.

&ldquo;I, escaping from hurt, more by chance than desert
(My brother on Tracy&rsquo;s estate is),
Have lived, I assert, sitting here in the dirt,
Upon nothing but berries and praties.

XXXVIII.

&ldquo;I was wounded, indeed; don&rsquo;t you see how I bleed?
And I&rsquo;ve had ne&rsquo;er a surgeon, which <i>is</i> hard;
But my master&rsquo;s sad need, and the loss of his breed,
'Tis <i>that</i>, sir, which sticks in my gizzard.

XXXIX.

&ldquo;My <span class="pagenum"><a name="link236" id="link236"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p236.jpg">236</a></span>strength &lsquo;gins to fail: want of beef and of ale
(How well I remember the brewin&rsquo;!)
My frame doth assail; but I&rsquo;ve told you the tale,
And your eyes may behold the sad ruin.&rdquo;

XL.

He stopped: faint and sore, he could utter no more,
But sank on the ground, softly sighing;
His troubles were o&rsquo;er: he was turned of four-score,
And was dead ere he knew he was dying.

XLI.

Sir Roderick stood at the tidings aghast:
Sad change from glad anticipation;
But he spoke out at last; not too loud or too fast,
But in accents of deep indignation.

XLII.

&ldquo;By all that is holy, by all that is blue,
By the eyes of adorable Ida,
Sir Marmaduke Tracy shall bitterly rue
The moment when first he espied her!

XLIII.

&ldquo;I vow and declare, and I solemnly swear,
That, fearless of dagger or bullet,
I&rsquo;ll rout out that bear from his murderous lair,
And slit his detestable gullet.

XLIV.

&ldquo;My life to the project henceforth I devote;
All else to this <i>one</i> shall knock under,
Till I fasten my hand on his treacherous throat
And tear the vile spoiler asunder!

XLV.

&ldquo;When <span class="pagenum"><a name="link237" id="link237"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p237.jpg">237</a></span>next here I tread, it shall be to be wed;
But I mustn&rsquo;t stay now any longer;
This old fellow&rsquo;s dead&mdash;there&rsquo;s no more to be said,
He has perished of wounds and of hunger.&rdquo;

XLVI.

Then he turned his horse round (who sprang off with a bound,
Accustomed in battle to dash on),
And with clattering sound, galloped over the ground
In a most irrepressible passion.

XLVII.

Two months had elapsed since that terrible day
When the Montmolon castle was taken,
And the baron and Ida were carried away
With small prospect of &ldquo;saving their bacon.&rdquo;

XLVIII.

The Tracy had taken them off to the rock
On which his own castle was builded;
Which, he boasted, was safe from an enemy&rsquo;s shock,
Whatever his valour or skill did.

XLIX.

Glenlighton its name; &rsquo;twas a beautiful place,
As you saw when you came nigh and nigher it;
But delectable Ida averted her face,
Too wrapt in her grief to admire it.

L.

Arrived, they were placed in a large suite of rooms,
Locked up, and a strong guard set by &lsquo;em,
And for weeks they saw none but retainers and grooms,
Who were ordered with food to supply &lsquo;em.

LI.

For <span class="pagenum"><a name="link238" id="link238"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p238.jpg">238</a></span>Sir Marmaduke Tracy had reason to ride
To some lord&rsquo;s in the neighbouring valley:
Ere he thought of a bride, he the spoils must divide
With the friends who&rsquo;d connived at his sally.

LII.

But returning (too soon!) one fine morning in June,
When brightly and warmly the sun shone,
He came whistling a tune all along the saloon,
And joined the small party at luncheon.

LIII.

&ldquo;Now, Baron,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;prithee hearken to me:
To escape you may shortly the way see:
If you e&rsquo;er would be free, you must quickly agree,
That your daughter becomes Lady Tracy.

LIV.

&ldquo;I am elderly, true; it were better for you
That death hadn&rsquo;t taken my son John.
But refuse! if you do, why, the day you shall rue
In a most insalubrious dungeon.&rdquo;

LV.

Says the Baron, &ldquo;I burn your assault to return,
And, spite of your luncheons and <i>he</i> cook,
My child will soon learn your proposals to spurn,
You lubberly son of a sea-cook!

LVI.

&ldquo;The battle you&rsquo;ve won, vile son of a gun,
Though more by your cunning than merit;
But, much though you&rsquo;ve done, I can tell you that none
Can break the true Montmolon spirit.

LVII.

&ldquo;Sir <span class="pagenum"><a name="link239" id="link239"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p239.jpg">239</a></span>Guy de la Vaux, I assuredly know,
Will avenge the foul trick that you&rsquo;ve played me;
And the Lord Montereaux to my rescue will go,
Though houseless and homeless you&rsquo;ve made me.

LVIII.

&ldquo;No daughter of mine to a man will incline
Who has murdered her father&rsquo;s retainers.
Those are <i>my</i> views in fine; my brave girl, I opine,
Will in language more pretty explain hers!&rdquo;

LIX.

Then Ida, &ldquo;Papa, all your sentiments are
My own&mdash;you are always so ready.
And besides, much I fear, that though mighty in war,
Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s rather unsteady.

LX.

&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m bound to declare, though hardly I dare
(And my courage is quite down at zero),
For <i>another</i> I care, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair
To give up my faithful young hero.

LXI.

&ldquo;I met him, you know, nearly five years ago,
Abroad, at the Henley regatta,
So I&rsquo;m bound to reply to Sir Marmaduke &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
Although his attentions may flatter.&rdquo;

LXII.

The Tracy laughed loud at the maiden so proud,
But, says he, &ldquo;Come, a truce to your chaffing;
It must be allowed that you don&rsquo;t seem much cowed,
But you&rsquo;ll find it no matter for laughing.

LXIII.

&ldquo;You, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link240" id="link240"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p240.jpg">240</a></span>madam, when cool, your affections must school
To follow Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s pleasure;
And, Baron, you fool and cantankerous mule,
In a dungeon shall ponder at leisure.

LXIV.

&ldquo;Nor think you secure that your friends will be truer
Than others have been in like cases;
Sir Guy is too poor, and I&rsquo;m perfectly sure
'Twill be long ere the Tracy he faces.

LXV.

&ldquo;And the Lord Montereaux died lately, I know
(He always was rather dyspeptic);
'Tis a good week ago since they popped him below,
Carried off by a fit epileptic.

LXVI.

&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis never my bent, you must know, to relent,
And trouble you&rsquo;re surely enough in,
So your aid must be lent to make Ida consent,
Unless you&rsquo;re a regular muffin.

LXVII.

&ldquo;Meantime, to a dungeon I&rsquo;ll order you off,
Where the damp very constant and dense is;
And when crippled entirely with fever and cough,
You&rsquo;ll probably come to your senses.&rdquo;

LXVIII.

He spoke, and withdrew, and the baron they threw
Into dungeon both damp and unpleasant;
And left him to ponder, as well he might do,
On the change from the past to the present.

LXIX.

Still, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link241" id="link241"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p241.jpg">241</a></span>with wonderful pluck, to his orders he stuck
That his child shouldn&rsquo;t marry the tyrant;
And Ida, sweet duck, though quite &ldquo;down on her luck,&rdquo;
 Still frowned on the daring aspirant.

LXX.

Then Sir Tracy, irate, said she tempted her fate,
Declining so firmly to choose him;
For he ne&rsquo;er could abate in his love for a mate,
Who he knew would be sorry to lose him.

LXXI.

Ten days he&rsquo;d allow her, he swore, when much vexed,
And partially drunk on his own ale;
But each day she refused to be his, on the next
Should be wrenched from her father a toe-nail!

LXXII.

Now the baron was gouty and tender of feet,
A man, too, of delicate nurture,
And to injure him thus would be making complete
The system of underground torture.

LXXIII.

So Ida she stood on the turreted wall
On that very identical even,
And loudly for aid and assistance did call
On Roderick Fowle and on Heaven.

LXXIV.

What is it she sees through the leaves of the trees?
By Jove! &rsquo;tis a warrior&rsquo;s banner,
And men, thick as bees, drawing nigh by degrees
In a most unmistakable manner.

LXXV.

She <span class="pagenum"><a name="link242" id="link242"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p242.jpg">242</a></span>views them approaching the castle so dread,
And prays they may soon overwhelm it;
For she sees they are led by a chief at their head
With a Hen, painted large, on his helmet.

</pre>
    <div class="fig" style="width:35%;">
      <img src="images/260s.jpg" alt="260s " width="100%" /><br />

    <h4>
      <a href="images/260.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a> -- <a
      href="images/260m.jpg"><i>Medium-Size</i></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      LXXVI. At this gladdening sight, she exclaimed in delight, &ldquo;My Fowle
      is at hand to assist me! I&rsquo;m positive quite I shall soon be all
      right, And again those dear lips will have kissed me!&rdquo; LXXVII. Sir
      Roderick true, as he came full in view And espied his adorable lady, Like
      a cock loudly crew, &ldquo;Im coming to you!&rdquo; And a spring towards
      the battlements made he. LXXVIII. He&rsquo;d got a siege-train (as I here
      should explain), And a terrible ram for to batter, Which with might and
      with main, plied again and again, The walls of the fortress should
      shatter. LXXIX. Then he shouted his war-cry,&mdash;well known in the East,&mdash;&rsquo;
      &ldquo;Cock-a-doodle!&rdquo; and brandished his pennon, Rushed on to the
      castle, not fearing the least, But urging his valorous men on. LXXX. The
      cruel Sir Marmaduke Tracy, meanwhile, Had been taking a quiet siesta, For
      he&rsquo;d promised poor Ida, with sinister smile, That day, that he
      wouldn&rsquo;t molest her. LXXXI. But, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link243" id="link243"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p243.jpg">243</a></span>hearing the
      shock, at the foot of the rock, He came up by the maiden upon it, Of his
      foeman took stock, and exclaimed, &ldquo;My young cock, &lsquo;Tis a
      daring attempt, had you won it!&rdquo; LXXXII. Fowle, clambering high,
      could invent no reply; Says Tracy, &ldquo;Though parleying <i>you</i>
      shun, Your end is so nigh, let me hope that to die You prepared ere you
      planned this intrusion.&rdquo; LXXXIII. Then a vast mass of brickwork he
      moved on a ledge Just above the unfortunate lover, And with all his great
      strength pushed it just to the edge Of the turret, then toppled it over.
      LXXXIV. With a rush and a roar, it went tumbling o&rsquo;er, With but
      little less rumble than thunder; Fowle&rsquo;s chance, small before, what
      event can restore If that terrible mass he lies under? LXXXV. Then Sir
      Marmaduke bowed to the maiden quite cowed While her flesh with sheer
      terror was creeping, And said, &ldquo;Madam so proud, it must now be
      allowed, There&rsquo;s no catching the Tracy a-sleeping.&rdquo; LXXXVI.
      &ldquo;Come near, without dread,&rdquo; he tauntingly said, &ldquo;On this
      ledge I will make by my side room; See, your lover is dead! so we now may
      be wed, And I&rsquo;ll make you a capital bridegroom!&rdquo; LXXXVII. But
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link244" id="link244"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p244.jpg">244</a></span>she looked with
      disdain, for, that moment, again From the thick cloud of dust just
      emerging, Fowle stood forth quite plain &lsquo;mid the wounded and slain
      His heroes to energy urging. LXXXVIII. &ldquo;False Tracy,&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;from my beautiful bride Avert your detestable gazes, Descend
      to my side that the fight may be tried!&rdquo; Says Sir Marmaduke, &ldquo;Fowle,
      go to blazes!&rdquo; LXXXIX. Quoth he, with a sneer, and a laugh and a
      jeer, &ldquo;Go home with your battering ram, Fowle; &lsquo;Tis perfectly
      clear I am better up here, So I think I shall stay where I am, Fowle!&rdquo;
      XC. He stood, winking his eye, on that battlement high, And was turning,
      poor Ida to wheedle, When the maiden, so spry, clapt her hand to his
      thigh, And thrust up to the hilt a sharp needle. XCI. With pain did he
      flush&mdash;gave a jump and a rush&mdash; Lost his balance&mdash;strove
      hard to re-win it, When she gave him a push, and with terrible crush He
      was over the cliff in a minute! XCII. The sides of the hill he clutched
      at, until&mdash; He found that he couldn&rsquo;t quite come it, So at last
      had his fill, and, exhausted, lay still, Having rolled to the foot from
      the summit. XCIII. And <span class="pagenum"><a name="link245" id="link245"></a><a

      lay, dying fast, in a way Which nobody willingly chooses; For the light of
      the day did his carcase display, A mass of incurable bruises. XCIV. Fowle&rsquo;s
      soldiers stood o&rsquo;er the poor man in his gore, Who groaned, &ldquo;I
      must go to &lsquo;Old Harry;&rsquo; &lsquo;Tis a terrible bore! I shall
      soon be no more, And you, Fowle, the damsel will marry. XCV. &ldquo;Lady
      Ida,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;has been too much for me; Her will in rough
      fashion she teaches. One comfort will be, that Fowle, do you see, Will
      find that his dame &lsquo;wears the breeches&rsquo;! XCVI. &ldquo;I am, I
      confess, in the deuce of a mess, With numbers of sins to repent of: There
      are some you may guess, but a lot more, unless I told you, you&rsquo;d
      never get scent of. XCVII. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had wives a full score: aye,
      I think twenty-four, Who at times I&rsquo;d by fraud or by force court:
      And I own that before I sought after more I ought to have tried the
      Divorce Court! XCVIII. &ldquo;In a dungeon down-stairs you&rsquo;ll find
      some of the &lsquo;fairs:&rsquo; I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to destroy
      &lsquo;em; But, in spite of their prayers, if they gave themselves airs,
      Sent them down, in the dark to enjoy &lsquo;em. XCIX. &ldquo;My <span

      href="../44425-page-images/p246.jpg">246</a></span>soldiers are
      bold; they had better be told There&rsquo;s nothing the fight should be
      won for: Their leader, though old, by a girl has been &lsquo;sold,&rsquo;
      And is most undeniably &lsquo;done for&rsquo;!&rdquo; C. He raised himself
      then, and bawled out to his men, &ldquo;No reason, my hearties, to fight
      on: The crest of the Hen will float over my den&mdash; Farewell to the
      Lord of Glenlighton!&rdquo; CI. Then he gave a great groan (as the Baron
      had done If they&rsquo;d tortured and made him a sore nail), And his side
      turning on, exclaimed, &ldquo;Crikey! I&rsquo;m gone And was instantly
      &ldquo;dead as a door-nail&rdquo;! CII. What need to relate how they
      opened the gate, And admitted Sir Fowle and his forces? How he entered in
      state, and showed clemency great, All this a mere matter of course is.
      CIII. And how the fair Ida sprang into his arms; How they built up the
      Montmolon Tower, I Dare say you can guess; and additional charms Fowle
      found in her ladyship&rsquo;s dowry. CIV. Glenlighton they seized; there
      was none to dispute: And Tracy&rsquo;s broad lands fared the same, too:
      The place and the country their fancy did suit, So they took all the land
      they laid claim to. CV. Nor <span class="pagenum"><a name="link247"

      it be said that ere long they were wed, These lovers, no more to be
      parted: Full soon the tree spread; and young children were bred; True <i>Fowles</i>&mdash;who
      were ne&rsquo;er <i>chicken-hearted</i>. CVI. That fort on the rocks (when
      repaired from the knocks Received in Sir Roderick&rsquo;s fighting) Made a
      snug little box, where, like true fighting-cocks, They live, at the hour I
      am writing. CVIII. Fowle&rsquo;s deeds are well known&mdash;not in <i>that</i>
      land alone, But, where&rsquo;er tales of valour hearts quicken, Men
      exclaim in loud tone to this day, &ldquo;We must own Such or such man&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;<i>as game as a chicken</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo; CVIII. The Baron lived
      long; he was healthy and strong, And never ate things one had best shun;
      So went in &ldquo;ding dong&rdquo; at the sound of the gong, And was blest
      with a wondrous digestion. CIX. Now I&rsquo;ve told all I know about Fowle
      and his foe, There&rsquo;s no more that requires explanation: On all I&rsquo;ll
      bestow my blessing, and so Conclude, with a bow, my narration.

    <p>
      As soon as the Monarch of the Rhine had finished his poetical legend (to
      which his companion listened with the most profound attention), he rose
      from his seat, and declared <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link248" id="link248"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p248.jpg">248</a></span>that he could
      really wait no longer, or he should be late for his appointment with those
      other continental rivers to which he had already alluded. Regret was
      plainly visible upon the countenance of Father Thames as his Brother Rhine
      expressed this determination, and he began to endeavour to persuade him to
      stay a little longer. He of the Rhine, however, seemed to be inexorable,
      and reminded his entertainer of the good old motto, &ldquo;Welcome the
      coming, speed the parting guest,&rdquo; which he declared that he had
      always held to be an exceedingly wise and proper saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Thames raised no objection to this, but at the same time observed
      that he also had several rivers who desired to see him, but that he had
      postponed their visit in order to do full justice to that of his foreign
      friend. The Isis and the Cam had indeed sent representatives to wait upon
      him, as was their annual custom, and enormous crowds of people in
      steamers, on barges, and on his banks had come out to witness the arrival
      and triumphant progress of these, which had taken place between Putney and
      Mortlake, and had as usual created great excitement. But other visitors he
      had put off, and had still more time to devote to the Rhine Monarch if he
      could be prevailed upon to stay. This, however, was impossible, and the
      two friends were about to part when Father Thames casually observed,
      &ldquo;I hope all will go well with you, Brother Rhine, until we meet
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other heaved a deep sigh. &ldquo;I hope so, indeed,&rdquo; he replied;
      &ldquo;but in these days of progress who can tell what will happen next?
      Instead of haunted castles I have now Legislative Bodies, which are often
      possessed by much worse spirits than those which occupied the old <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link249" id="link249"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p249.jpg">249</a></span>ruins; instead
      of giants I have Ministers; and in the place of river-demons an
      enlightened Press; and goodness only knows what may become of me at any
      moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; responded Father Thames, &ldquo;have trials which
      are almost beyond endurance. What with Water Companies, Conservancy
      Boards, and Embankments, I have of late years been driven nearly wild; and
      although they have at some places given up the fine old practice of
      draining into my waters everything that was foul and abominable, and thus
      creating a public nuisance in the shape of disagreeable and unwholesome
      odours, which they afterwards had the impudence to attribute to me, and
      associate the nuisance with my name, yet I am scurvily treated by mankind
      in general, and made the unwilling receptacle of dead cats and other
      unpleasant objects, and have my water taken from me in large quantities,
      when I would much rather retain it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is very bad,&rdquo; remarked the Rhine King. &ldquo;Why
      not leave such a country and come home with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; drily returned Father Thames, &ldquo;not even
      the blessings which you have enumerated as now in your possession could
      tempt me to take such a step. I should miss my beef and ale too much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ale!&rdquo; hastily interrupted his companion. &ldquo;How you
      continue to harp upon that beverage of yours, which, after all, cannot
      compare with that which I drink on mine own river. Come, good brother,
      before I go let me sing you one of our famous Rhine songs in honour of the
      immortal wine with which my banks are blessed.&rdquo; And without more ado
      about the matter, the Rhine <span class="pagenum"><a name="link250"
      id="link250"></a><a href="../44425-page-images/p250.jpg">250</a></span>Monarch
      sang as follows in a rich and voice:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I.

&ldquo;A fig for your sherry or foaming champagne!
I&rsquo;d not give a groat for the whole of your stock;
Of thirst if I hear my companions complain,
I hold out my bottle with&mdash;&lsquo;Accipe Hoc!
Accipe Hoc, Accipe Hoc!&rsquo;
I hold out my bottle with&mdash;&lsquo;Accipe Hoc!&rsquo;

II.

&ldquo;At night your port-wine bibber drowsily nods,
And wakes hot and heavy at crowing of cock;
The liquor offer is fit for the gods,
And blesses the drinker, so&mdash;&lsquo;Accipe Hoc!
Accipe Hoc, Accipe Hoc!&rsquo;
It blesses the drinker, so&mdash;&lsquo;Accipe Hoc!&rsquo;

III.

&ldquo;Of brandy and whisky I sing not in praise,
For feet they make stagger and heads they make rock;
But the man who is hoping to lengthen his days,
Should list to my counselling&mdash;&lsquo;Accipe Hoc!
Accipe Hoc,&rsquo; &amp;c.

IV.

&ldquo;Away with your brewing, away with your ale!
(Though such a proposal your feelings may shock;)
For all your malt liquors infallibly pale
Before my Rhine vintage, so&mdash;&lsquo;Accipe Hoc!
Accipe Hoc,&rsquo; &amp;c.

V.

&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis wine that ne&rsquo;er robs man of senses or wit,
But hearts can make lively and tongues can unlock;
Makes dull men for once for good company fit,
And bright ones still brighter, so&mdash;&lsquo;Accipe Hoc!
Accipe Hoc,&rsquo; &amp;c.

VI.

&ldquo;Come, fill up your glasses! the toast shall be mine,
And loud in applause on the table you&rsquo;ll knock;
When I give you &lsquo;The glorious vintage of Rhine!&rsquo;
And long may each comrade sing, &lsquo;Accipe Hoc!
Accipe Hoc, Accipe Hoc!&rsquo;
Long may each comrade sing, &lsquo;Accipe Hoc!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As <span class="pagenum"><a name="link251" id="link251"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p251.jpg">251</a></span>the Monarch of
      the Rhine proceeded, I observed a cloud gathering over the brow of Father
      Thames, which grew darker when uncomplimentary allusion was made to his
      favourite ale, and by the time that his guest had concluded his song had
      deepened into a tremendous and awful frown. Scarcely was the last word out
      of the singer&rsquo;s mouth than he burst forth in fury. &ldquo;Brooks and
      fountains!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a loud voice, &ldquo;is it thus I am to
      be insulted upon mine own waters? and am I to sit still and be silent
      while these insolent foreigners extol their thin and miserable drinks at
      the expense of the noble beverage upon which Britons have fattened and
      thriven ever since they were a people? Off with thee now, then, as soon as
      thou listest, thou hock-swilling loon, for I cannot put up with such
      trash!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rhine King had already risen; but at these words the greatest
      astonishment was depicted upon his countenance, for he had really meant no
      offence, so far as I could see, and for my own part I was myself
      astonished at the conduct of Father Thames in taking notice of such a
      trifle. He did so, however, and was apparently quite ready to follow up
      his words with corresponding actions; for, reaching out his left hand, he
      raised from beside him a species of instrument somewhat resembling a
      three-pronged fork, which I had not noticed before, and overset his
      tumbler with his right hand in the action. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link252" id="link252"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p252.jpg">252</a></span>This appeared to
      exasperate him still more, and as his companion muttered something about
      the effects of too much ale being to make a man lose his temper, he
      appeared to get more and more angry, and made as though he would rise.

      Upon this the Monarch of the Rhine tarried no longer, but made a sudden
      bolt of it, carrying a couple of curiously shaped spears in his left hand,
      and leading in his right his attendant eagle, tied with a string which was
      fastened to a collar round its neck. In this undignified manner the Rhine
      King rushed off the island, and I was so thoroughly ashamed at the rude
      and inhospitable conduct of my native river that I anxiously started
      forward to stop the stranger king&rsquo;s flight, to offer apologies, and,
      if possible, to set matters right between the two. In so doing, however,
      something struck my hat from my head, and with the shock I awoke, and sat
      up amazed. There, indeed, was <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link253" id="link253"></a><a
      href="../44425-page-images/p253.jpg">253</a></span>the dear old
      river flowing on and on at my feet; there was the island, and upon it were
      the reeds and willows as usual, but the River Monarchs were nowhere to be
      seen. They had passed away like a dream, and no doubt I should be told
      that all I had seen and heard was only the results of a visit to dreamland
      during my nap that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting dark, and I could only just see the stately shape of
      Windsor Castle rearing itself above the town in the distance, whilst, to
      the left, the buildings of my beloved Eton appeared to be shadows fading
      away in the fast-approaching darkness of night. &ldquo;Absit omen!&rdquo;
      I exclaimed as I sprang to my feet. &ldquo;The glory of Eton shall never
      fail whilst England is England; and, least of all, shall the love of her
      sons for the dear old college ever fade or lessen whilst life endures. I,
      at least, will be a boy as long as I live in my love for Eton and Eton
      boys, and to their approval will I submit the legends which I have heard
      here to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Filled with these thoughts, I hurried home as fast as I could, and wrote
      down from memory what I had heard and seen, resolving, if possible, to
      obtain some further information from the same sources if ever the
      opportunity should again present itself.
